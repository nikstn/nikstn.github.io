Then lens had no discernable distortion anywhere.  It magnified everything evenly without the ripples and  distortion that I've seen with other low cost magnifiers.  This light is a nice touch and easy to use.  If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit.  It is focused very close to the center of what you will be look at and provides nice, even coverage.What I didn't like was the brightness (actually dimmness) of the light and where it is focused.  LEDs can be lots brighter, I know as I've seen them.  Also, the light focuses at the center of you field of view but only when the lens is too close to be focused properly.Bottom line is this is a good value for a magnifier and could have been made great with better quality control.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.

They had one open so you could try it out.  I only tried it for less than 10 minutes but that was enough.  Personally I think this is one of the worst ideas I have seen in a long time that is a product of one of those annoying TV commercials.  The idea of it is that it supposed to be easier to hold this thing over your book and hover it there continuously while you read, as opposed to just wearing glasses, ....Or something. (I think a newer model I saw on TV recently has a light, but that doesn't come off as any improvement on it in my opinion).  No question that if you get this thing just right it can magnify the page of your book or whatever it is you are using it for, but the fact that it actually works is where the benefits of this thing ends.  For starters, even if you are not reading one of the books that requires two hands for it closes on you the second you relax your grip on it,(as most of them are), this thing has to be positioned just right all the time in order to magnify the page successfully.  Move it back and forth just a little and your page becomes a blur.  There are no attachments to this thing, your hand is the tool, and in no time you start to have it get tired, go to sleep, etc.  There is not even a handle anywhere on this thing.  You just hold it someplace along the edge where you can sometimes find yourself magnifying nothing but your own finger.  Lastly, this thing is not glare resistant.  Depending on your light source, you will occasionally have to move or adjust it just to see.  Or better yet, forget about it it all together which is what I suggest overall.  There are several of these page magnifiers available here on Amazon.  The cheaper ones are much smaller.  Actually, I think a smaller ones is a wiser investment than this more expensive full page model.  The smaller one can be a handy tool to have around when you are trying to read that horrible tiny print on such things as medicine bottles, instructions, etc.  And its much cheaper than this model.

All I can say is good choice by me!  It absolutely takes some getting used to (buy a Dabon by Pinaud styptic pencil at the same time) but once you get a handle on it you won't regret the switch.  This type of shaving produces a closer shave than i ever got with the most expensive multi-blade cartridges and now I'm down to one or two nicks a week, mostly because I forget to take my time.  Start out angling the razor by raising your wrist in order to avoid slicing yourself up and as you get used to it gradually lower the wrist and you'll see the true effectiveness of the razor.  This particular model has plenty of heft.  It looks and feels like the quality tool that it is.  Get yourself a badger hair bursh and some Taylor of Bond Street shaving cream, crank up the hot water and enjoy the gentlemanly ritual of a quality shave.  Pick up some after shave cream in order to soothe your skin because if you've been shaving with cartridges your face won't be used to the closeness of this shave.  Also, keep a few cartridges around for those mornings when you're running late.

What does this actually mean?  Well, every battery can provide you a certain amount of energy over a specific time frame (basically: discharge at a specific rate of current).  The rate of discharge is usually in miliamps per hour or mAh.What I've  recently noticed is that we have a TON of Energizer brand NiMH rechargeable batteries, along with the 15 minute charger.  (All of which work VERY well...)However, it turns out the there is a problem:  the batteries are all rated at different current rates:  some are 2450mAh, others are 2200 mAh, and still others are 2500 mAh.Why is this a problem?  Well,  it turns out that you can't mix and match different versions of these batteries in sensitive electronic equipment.So, if you are going to invest in the batteries you need to purchase a bunch of them at once and they really need to be exactly the same mAh rating.Other things to note:  most of the really good batteries are made in Japan.  Some of the recently produced versions are made in China, not Taiwan, but China... And the quality of these may be dubious.  Time will tell...  The biggest issue is something called \"low discharge rate,\" which means the unused NiMH batteries typically made in Japan or Taiwan will hold a charge for years (older, less advanced rechargeables need to be charged every 6 months to a year)Lastly, you need to know that NiMH rechargibles run at 1.2 volts, not 1.5 volts.  So this means that certain electronics may not work properly with lower current / voltage rechargibles.  Typically, this is not an issue... But it IS a problem if you mix two different Energizer AA batteries of different mAh ratings in a device that takes multpe AA batteries.  (I recently ran into this issue with an L3 thermal imager and an older night vision PVS-4 optical scope.  Both work without issue if the batteries are same mAh rating, but fail to work properly when using mixed versions of the Energizer batteries... and the L3 thermal site specifcally indicates it will work with rechargable NiMH batteries!)Moral of the story:Pros:- if you have devices the use tons of batteries,  rechargeables are for you- the 15 minute energizer charger actually works very well- you can get sleeves that allow you to use the AA batteries in devices using C or D type battery devices... (Enerloop comes to mind) and this will work with medium power requirement C and D devices- after the initial investment, you start saving a lot of moneyCons:- if you have devices that really need 1.5 volt batteries, NiMH can be a problem ( for those things, go and purchase Lithium AA batteries... They work very well in most of the high power requiring devices I've played with... But so have the Japaese made 2450mAh NiMH Energizer rechargables.- you really need to pay strict attention to batches of Energizer batteries you have, if they are all over the place went you read the little green tag on the that says \" 2450mAh,\" \"2200mAh,\" or \"2500mAh,\" you will have problems with them.

But once you received it, you may be shocked to find out that: the rated capacity of those NEW batteries is just '2300mAh', lower than the previous generation of '2500mAh' Energizer NiMH cells. So are you really getting a new and improved product, or just some old inventory from many years ago?The fact is, Energizer has discontinued the '2500mAh' series of rechargeable AA NiMH cells, presumably due to massive complaints about rapid-self-discharge problem. All new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells, using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer. Here are my findings:- Fresh out of the package, those cells hold an average of 330mAh, or just 14% of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time, they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles, the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations, I can conclude that those 'New' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity. They are not the LSD (low-self-discharge) type pioneered bySANYO eneloop. This is very disappointing, because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced LSD products similar to eneloop, such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged. In contrast, the Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back' its battery technology to circa 2004.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is: they _probably_ don't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells.In summary, those so-called 'New' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than LSD NiMH cells (2000-2100mAh), yet do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate. As of this writing, this product is priced at nearly 2x higher than LSD cells.

This means that within a short period of time (for me about 7-10 days) they will be completely dead even if you completely charged them and never used them.  The only reason I didn't give these batteries 1 star is because they do work well right out of the charger.  But you pretty much have to use them within 2-3 days of charging.  Wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged.  I  know I didn't just get a bad batch either because I have a couple dozen of these Energizers which I purchased over the course of 2+ years.  I didn't notice the discharge rate at first because I used to charge my batteries pretty frequently to make sure I always had a fresh set in whatever device I was using.  But eventually I started noticing that even my \"freshly charged\" batteries weren't lasting very long.  So I started paying closer attention to how frequently I charged my batteries and realized that even after a week they would be mostly or completely dead.I've switched over to Rayovac Hybrids and Sanyo Eneloops which both have a much lower self-discharge.  I've very happy with both of them and would definitely recommend either of them over these Energizers.

How does a product that is so bad, get such great distribution and remain available for sale?  Energizer probably gets off easy, because it takes a while for their batteries to go bad.

{"reviewerID": "A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9", "asin": "B00000JHQ6", "reviewerName": "NyiNya \"NyiNya\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very, very thorough, erudite and insightful job of it.  So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters.  I am the last person on earth to demean batteries. I mean, where would we be without them?  No flashlights, no little handfans. No smoke detectors. Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel? I remember those days and it was hell.  No, we need batteries. Without batteries, our favorite gizmos would be useless...but how do you tell them apart?The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike. They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight, making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom.  I am happy to report that they did not explode, burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior.  I remember in the old days, batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you. You'd open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting. I have never seen a Duracell do this, but to be fair, I have seen no other battery do it either, not for many, many years. Obviously we have come a long, long way in terms of Battery technology.The D, by the way was plainly marked, so there could be no mistake...although the size is a dead give away. In the box with your other batteries, they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts. So were the little Plus and Minus signs, so you would know which end went in first.  Although they could have been a little bigger, now that I think of it.  A lot bigger.  But none of the other batteries offer this large print, so I won't take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies \"Durable\" so I expected a tough battery -- but really, how tough does it have to be? I'm not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight, am I?  So duration is really the only thing to measure, beyond the other factors previously mentioned.  Now I know some batteries claim to last longer, the energizer bunny and all that, but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less, so it's hard to judge.  I'm assuming if one really did outperform all the others, it would be common knowledge, but it's not, so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating.  On the other hand, I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store.  I think they were call Emmagizers, so naturally I was fooled.  They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice, particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker.  So, five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment, sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors, and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question: Wouldn't it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably, when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer, the flashlight that burns out requires Cs, and when you buy C cells, the next Gizmo needs Ds.  And it doesn't matter anyway because when you get to the store, you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size.  And those little guys, the AAs? What's the story with them?  How many penlights are we carrying around already.  And don't get me started on those square guys. And while we're at it, how come there are no B cell batteries? One more thing...those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery...the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery. SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious...like it's all being rigged by some international battery cartel. I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off.

I have been converting over to Eneloop Rechargeables this year for AA and AAA batteries to minimize cost and waste, but there are no rechargeable 9V batteries yet.  Due to this price increase, I purchased a set of Rayovac Pro 9 Volts to see how they perform.

My parting comment to all who were in this elevator with me - \"Why didn't YOU have a flashlight with you?\"My ONLY gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath, which is durable -- not only allows the flashlight to fall out in some situations, but it does not keep the rotating head of the flashlight protected. More than once someone has come up to me to say \"Umm.... your BELT is all lit up!!\"  I solved that problem by sewing a (rip-stopped) strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath (back to front), and attaching velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath, so now my maglite stays securely in the sheath.Would I buy aother Maglite?

Just be aware that there is no button; you must rotate the head to turn it on, meaning you need two hands.  This is NOT the flashlight to keep by your bed at night, because if you hear a sound and have to reach for protection and the light, you will be fumbling to turn this on.  Yes, it is possible, with practice, to turn it on with one hand--if your hand is large and strong enough (but not too large!).Another situation:  If you are out walking in the evening and a car starts coming towards you, a button to turn on the light quickly is much better than fumbling around trying to twist the head.Of course if your hand is sweaty or you have put on some lotion and suddenly need a light, again, you need two hands, and even then, you are fumbling.On a postive note:  One way to measure a flashlight's quality is by how well it preserves batteries when not in use.

While it is not expensive ($11, 14 lumens), the old incandescent light bulb technology lacks in many aspects when compared to the new LED technology. If you still like the Maglite design, they offer three Mini Maglite LED technologies; the Mini Maglite LED ($16, 77 lumens), Mini Maglite LED Pro ($20, 226 lumens), and the Mini Maglite LED Pro Plus ($24, 245 lumens bright mode).I found a Mini Maglite once tossed on the side of a rural road at a sharp turn. One can only imagine how it got there. Regardless, the body had some deep scores and dents in it, as if it rolled quite far and maybe even got run over a time or two. I was definitely surprised when I turned the head (it still turned smoothly and easily) and the light turned on, dim and yellow, of course, but steady. I took it home and added it to one of my emergency kits. Unfortunately, I placed bad batteries in it, which swelled up and corroded, causing problems with the springs inside. It was not too much of a loss as it was obtained for free, but the Maglite itself was great while it lasted.I plan on getting the Pro Plus as my primary EDC flashlight as it is made in the USA, to replace my cheap Ultrafire AA flashlight which has been showing random switch issues. While still quite outdated (Maglite is just catching up with the Mag-tac line), the price for the Pro Plus is about one half to one third of the price one would pay for a full-feature tactical light from 4Sevens, Fenix, or Zebralight, which despite their steep prices are all made in China.However, if you have a sentimental attachment to the dim yellow beam of a USA-made Maglite, buy it.

I did a lot of shooting over the weekend that I was waiting for my rechargeable batteries to arrive, and I even used the LCD display occasionally to shoot with and to review my photos (something that, on this camera, would make other batteries die instantly). But the Energizers continued to work great.A week later, I had my rechargeables, but the energizers were still working, so I decided to keep them in until they died. I haven't done a whole lot of shooting...mostly a few shots here and there on weekends, as I get used to how the camera works. I was surprised when the batteries lasted through another weekend. Then another, then another. These batteries literally got me through two months of casual weekend shooting (say, a couple dozen shots or more per weekend), even with the LCD display on. For a relatively inexpensive set of \"throwaway\" batteries, and knowing how poorly other batteries performed with this camera, I couldn't have been happier with the performance of these.

Toll \"Consumer Doc\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Lithium Cells are rapidly becoming the new gold standard for many household uses, from simple flashlights to sophisticated hybrid vehicles.  These lithium-ion batteries are now ubiquitous at the retail level and their popularity has steadily increased because of their power efficiency compared to more traditional delivery technologies far surpassing carbon-zinc, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and alkaline.Here Is my Assessment of The Energizer AAA \"Ultimate\" Lithium:PROS:1. Superior in power efficiency compared to above-cited technologies.  Lithium cells hold their charge longer and become superior performers in retaining their charge.  When stored properly (in a cool, dry and dark environment), these cells self-discharge rates are substantially slower compared with previous generations of batteries.2. Unlike nickel-cadmium cells, lithium-ion batteries have no (or a very negligible) \"memory\" effect.3. Lithium Cells appear less likely to leak and are not as vulnerable to extreme temperatures compared with previous technologies.4. Lithium-Ion cells also perform better at lower ambient temperatures than their predecessors.5. Lithium-Ion batteries are noticeably lighter than previous types of cells making it an additional plus in heavier types of equipment such as larger flashlights, power equipment, etc.6. Energizer cells have expiration dates considerably longer because they discharge much more slowly compared to previous generations of batteries.7. Lithium cells are more environmentally-compliant and friendly compared to previous generations, particularly those cells which contain toxic, heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.CONS:1. My rating on these cells is 4.5 stars due to the perceived steep price points of the Energizer brand that most folks believe.  However, if you do the math, as another astute reviewer has, you will find that lithium cells are actually a more cost-effective choice when compared to an equivalent-sized alkaline battery.  Nevertheless, you are still likely to pay more for a name brand such as Energizer, in order for the company to recoup their research and development costs.2. Lithium cells may be a safety hazard, particularly when exposed to high temperatures for sustained periods of time.  For this reason, the federal government has imposed transport restrictions on lithium batteries.  Although these restrictions have recently been relaxed, lithium cells can and do explode because they contain a pressurized, flammable electrolyte. For this reason, it is advisable to store these cells in a temperature-stable environment.3. Energizer currently has several different \"versions\" of their \"Ultimate\" Lithium batteries on the retail market.  Some packages state \"up to 4x longer\" while newer versions announce on the front of the blister card up to 8x or 9x longer in selected devices.  Be careful to select the latest available expiration date card(s) to avoid purchasing an earlier version of the product. Each cell also has a production/ lot code embossed on it; however, they are not at present, user-identifiable without assistance from Energizer.BOTTOM LINE:1. These are excellent batteries when used properly and in the correct equipment.  In consideration of the longer storage and discharge interval, my recommendation would be to use lithium cells for those appliances and equipment requiring longer replacement intervals such as fire, smoke and CO2 detectors; water sensors, outdoor sensors, digital cameras and remote controls to name just a few.2. Avoid storing these cells in extreme temperatures-cool, dark and dry is recommended for maximum shelf life and safety. Avoid storing lithium cells in the refrigerator or freezer.3. Energizer lithiums are, in my opinion, no better than those manufactured by other reputable companies.  As such, price shop.  If store (generic) lithiums are available, shop with your wallet.  This is an excellent technology but you need to use and store them wisely.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Takes A Lickin' but Keeps On Tickin'!", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2013"}

Last time I was at the store he persuaded me to buy more rechargeable batteries because they cost about the same price as lithium batteries like these.  He said that the reason our rechargeable batteries that we already had didn't work is because they were old and we had used them too many times.  That sounded reasonable to me, so I went with it.I was so frustrated to discover that they drained very quickly.  Within a few days of moderate usage in my camera, they were done.  Same thing for the second set.  I went to take pictures of a home I'm renting and when I turned the camera on it was dead, so Ihad to go with random batteries that were floating around in the bottom of my purse--were they there because they were good, just in case, or there because they were dead?  I didn't know, but I had to find out, because I needed those pictures!  The mystery batteries gave me a \"low battery\" warning the whole time I used them, but I got the pictures before they ran out, so it worked out okay.But then my sister was getting married this past Saturday and I knew I couldn't chance it with unreliable rechargeables.  I needed a battery that would be there with oomph when I was ready for it.  I didn't want to be fumbling around changing batteries six times, and I knew my family would all be in town.  I would be so upset if I missed out on pictures of my baby with her cousin that is her same age, or if I couldn't get the special picture with my grandpa--my daughter's great-grandpa--when the opportunity came about.So I did what any sensible, thinking person would do.  I gave up on rechargeables completely and ordered these lithium batteries from Amazon with one day shipping.  They came in the morning, and I was ready all weekend with my camera.  I got all of the pictures and video that I wanted for the whole weekend, and guess what, my camera STILL is not threatening me with a low battery warning.If you want to save in every way possible, maybe these are not for you.If you want batteries that WORK, every time, when you want them to, these batteries will make all of your dreams come true.They're not the cheapest option out there, but it is such a relief to have batteries that you can depend on.

Some locations were a royal pain to get to and I did not want to try and change 4 batteries with 8 tiny screws on my roof very often.Enter the L91BP.  Batteries have a price.  There is the cost of acquisition here on amazon, disposal, and the time spent replacing them.  Let's say you estimate your time at $40/hr which is reasonable for any engineer.Assuming a good grade alkaline is $1/cell and these are $2/cell to change 4 batteries I am spending an extra $4.  If they last 7 times longer, I've avoided 6 trips up on the roof to change them.  If it takes me 1 hour to remove and re-install the batteries, then clearly at $40/hr I have come out ahead buying the more expensive cells, since I saved 6 changes, or $240 worth of my time.I also put a second temp meter in my deep freeze and set an alarm on it on the receiver.  Because alkaline cells dont perform in sub-0 temps, I used the L91-BPs again for that application.Now the products that are easy to change the battery in did not get the lithium cells, however they may if removing the 8 tiny screws without loss becomes a pain.Cons:Because of their 1.7V output, some flashlights may be overvoltaged with 4 of these in series and caution not to use lithium AA cells.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Longest running AA battery", "unixReviewTime": 1273795200, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2010"}

Simply putting these in a TV remote would be a complete waste of money due to thier price.  However, when used in an apllication that requires increased performance, these batteries are completely worth the price you pay.Mostly, I use them for flashlights for camping and other tasks around the house.  They not only make my flashlights last longer, they increase the brightness and will not fail in freezing temperatures.  I own some pretty expensive flashlights also.  The lithiums are far less likely explode or leak like alkaline have been known to do.  It has happened to me and ruined a flashlight on me.  That being said, I recommend these for your high-end electronics like digital cameras or two-way radios and the like.  They will perform better and will not be ruined by a battery malfunction.The other great thing for the camping aspect is the lightweight of the batteries themselves.  This allows me to pack them into my system and not worry about weight as they feel seemingly hollow, almost cheaply light.I highly recommend the Powerpax battery caddy sold here on amazon for storage in camera bags or your camping system.  They keep them from coliding with each other and getting damaged.  You can seem my in-depth review on these items as well to gain an idea of how well they function.You can also buy these in bulk as the shelf life is 15-16 years as advertised.

For high-drain applications, it offers great advantages over ordinary alkaline cell and rechargeable NiMH cell. However, it is also very expensive as a disposable battery. So it is important to recognize the strength of L92, and use it only in applications that give you the best results. Otherwise you'll be wasting your money.According to data sheet published by Energizer, the capacity of this Lithium AAA cell (L92) is 1200mAh. This number remains nearly constant with load current. In comparison, the ordinary Alkaline battery (such as the Energizer E92) is also rated as 1200mAh, but only at a very light load of 25mA. At a heavy load of 500mA (typical for a P&S; digital camera), its capacity is reduced to about one-third. The difference gets even greater at low temperature. At zero degree C and 500mA load, the L92 can provide about seven times more energy compared to the E92. This is where the marketing claim of \"Last up to 7 times longer\" comes from.When used in a digital camera at room temperature of 25 degree C, the L92 is more likely to last 3-4 times longer than alkaline. This is enough to justify its price, which is also around 3-4 times higher than alkaline. However, in low-drain applications (such as smoke detector, wireless mouse or remote control) alkaline cells will last just as long at a fraction of the cost.The L92 also contains much higher energy when compared to rechargeable NiMH cell such as theSanyo Eneloop AAA. This is partially due to its higher terminal voltage of 1.5V, which is 20% higher than that for NiMH.Energy stored in eneloop AAA: 0.8Ah * 1.25V = 1.0Wh,Energy stored in L92 : 1.2Ah * 1.5V = 1.8Wh (80% higher).Higher terminal voltage for L92 is especially advantageous in digital camera applications, because your camera flash will recharge up to 20% faster. On the other hand, it may create problems with some applications such as unregulated LED flash light. Higher than expected voltage will make the lamp burn brighter, but the excessive heat may also cause the lamp to burn out quickly.Bottom line: If you need AAA batteries for a long hiking trip or for emergency standby, then L92 is obviously your best choice. For most other situations, I recommend using low self-discharge NiMH cells for lower operating cost.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Match those batteries with the correct application for best result", "unixReviewTime": 1216598400, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2008"}

By comparison, afterwards, I used traditional alkaline AAs and the same devices lasted only a few short weeks.Now I am again enjoying the benefits of these lithium batteries.  This 8-pack sold on Amazon is a particularly great value. At first I thought the lithium batteries were too expensive, when I saw a 2-pack in a store, for nearly ten dollars.  With this package on Amazon, the batteries usually cost around two dollars each.  A great value and not much more than alkaline batteries, for a lot longer lasting power!Lithium batteries also work better in extreme temperatures.  If you, for example, have an outside thermostat for a weather station, this will work in the winter, whereas an alkaline battery may not.An interesting tip, when my higher power devices, like bluetooth keyboard, runs low on power.  I go ahead and pop one of the used lithium batteries into a clock.  I'm not sure how long it will last, but it's a great way to recycle at least a few of your almost drained lithium batteries.Now I've started using these, new,  in powered toothbrushes, and I find it's a lot more powerful and longer lasting.I highly recommended these for devices that quickly drain regular alkaline varieties.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nothing to Argue About", "unixReviewTime": 1258934400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2009"}

Good grief, what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow, coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush, which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip, wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces, from tile to carpet.

How do you talk about how wonderful a bottle cleaning brush is without it getting creepy/awkward? &#34;Oh, its amazing!!&#34; &#34;It sure gets the job done!&#34; &#34;Better than all the rest!&#34; &#34;So Sturdy!&#34; Etc. Moving on ...... I didn't really bottle feed my babies, but I did have a supply of bottles and got the cursory bottle brush to along with them. In the past 3 years or so, I was also given one and bought another, all rusted, never felt like they did a thorough job, and/or broke in half or the end bristles flattened. Then I saw this one on Amazon, and using other OXO products with success I bought my 4th bottle brush in 2.5 years. It's been over a year now and I'm still contented with the one I have with no thought to replace it. Bristles still clean effectively, wand/handle part is still maintaining the perfect balance of flexible but sturdy, and it doesn't look grungy. I do like the bristles better on this one than other brushes, soft, not wiry, but obviously sturdy. I was always left with the feeling that other standard bottle brushes would carry bacteria on the sponge ends, or scratch the inside of the bottles because they were too wiry. Now, I don't give bottles to my kids anymore, but I do bottle our own kombucha and want to make sure the bottles are quite clean, this brush serves that purpose. I find that I also use it to clean sport bottles, juicing equipment and cylindrical objects more often than not. I even took it over to my moms house to clean some coffee carafes (worked great) and accidentally left it there, and I really miss it this week of being without it!! Oh, I also use it to clean my Chemex. Works so great!!!I would like to say that a narrower one would be wonderful too, this fits in everything except my flip top bottles.

It does the flat surfaces quickly and easily gets into the corners and crevices.Here's a great tip I've learned after much experimentation. Clean your shower with a spray bottle filled with one cup of white vinegar and three cups of water - add a few drops of dish soap if you like. The vinegar retards mold and mildew very effectively, and it's much easier on my nose than the chlorine bleach products I had been using.The same vinegar solution is great for water bottles, watch bands, and anything else that has a tendency to start smelling like an old dish rag.

I didn't bother checking the details of my battery's characteristics, assuming that a \"short skinny battery\" would be all I needed to remember. I found a couple of batteries that more or less looked like my garage door's battery so I bought them, only to discover that they were the wrong kind. I went back to the store, this time bringing my battery with me, only to discover that they did not carry this particular kind. That's when I decided to look for it on Amazon. I found the exact battery that I used thus far - Duracell A21/23, but then I also came across these Energizer A23s. They were somewhat cheaper, but I was not sure if A23 is exactly the same as A21/23. The batteries were pretty cheap though, so I decided to give it a try. I am happy to report that they fit into my remote opener perfectly and they worked without a hitch from the get go. I am so glad that I don't have to call home from my cell phone while driving any more, asking my wife to open the garage door for me!I liked the fact that there were no shipping charges for these batteries. They seem to last for at least four to five years with my level of usage, but I decided to get an extra pair just in case.

The secret to using it is hand rubbing, as opposed to the way you wax your car.  It cleans and polishes while laying down a coat of preservative wax.  This 0000 pad from 3M is perfect for the application.  You can use the less fine pad (they use different colors for different coarseness/fineness), especially on steel tools.I use 0000 steel wool.  But sometimes you do not want to risk leaving any of those fine steel fibers behind to rust.  These pads actually hold their shape better than wools, which tend to separate under pressure, so these go further.I also like these pads for pumice and rottenstone, getting a good load of paraffin oil.  You get good control over them for polishing and fine abrasive work.

The added benefit is real clean windows.  Thanks to our changing weather conditions around here we and several of our neighbors have had outdoor visitors feel as if they were welcome inside.  The key is to eliminate the means in which they can enter.  One of those is the holes where pipes come in from washing machines or water facilities from the wells and on and on.  I pack each entry hole that will not carry electricity with steel wool and the 4/0 is best because if you are a mouse and begin to eat steel you might get an urge for an antacid or stool softener.

You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.

After your gums get accustomed to the massage, and the intensity of the brushing, you will know that it is one of the single best things you have done to your smile.When flossing, my gums used to bleed, now they don't bleed any more. I had gum lines that were receding, even though some of them were only back 1 to 3 on a scale of 10. I had a wisdom tooth that incurred periodontal disease, The dentist went around it with a metal probe, to release the infection, and gave me a prescription for antibiotics. He explained that it would be healed, but still must be pulled because it would for sure return. I guess once that infection gets down under the tooth, it sets up shop, and returns. I had to go to a dental surgeon and have it removed. After that, I got a scolding from the dental hygienist. She explained that all the the bleeding that I was getting from my gums when flossing was not normal. It was due to bacteria. So I started to scrub more often, and floss, and use an alcohol based mouthwash. (Most of them are)It wasn't until I started to use the Sonicaire toothbrush that I really noticed a change. No more bleeding gums (unless I abuse the floss) My gums have moved down. I had a crown placed on a tooth that was far enough gone, that when the crown was put on, I could take a fingernail, and push the gum up slightly, and feel the top of the crown. Now I push the gum up with my fingernail, and the top of the crown is entirely inaccessable.Why should you get a Sonicaire toothbrush? Consider that most tooth aches come from Gingivitus. That is an irritation of the gum line. Tartar and plaque join forces with bacteria, and wage a war with your gum line. Scrubbing with baking soda and some peroxide used to take care of that for me.(Being careful not to swallow any of it.) Now with Sonicaire, I never get Gingivitus any more. The next level is Periodontal disease as I explained earlier. Once you get that, if it is a crown, or a tooth, they are forced to do bridgework. I don't know if you have checked the prices on bridgework, but forget about that new car. Regular brushing with Sonicaire, with regular dental check ups, flossing, and a good mouthwash, and you can help prevent all of that. Now let's get on to the fun stuff.I can notice a substantial improvement in the color of my teeth. They are white now, instead of manila. (I won't say yellow) Seriously, I smile in the mirror with the light on, just to delight in the new shade of white my teeth have become.On a practical note: I use the Sonicaire in the shower, even though the instructions tell you not to. Immersing the unit, is definitely not advisable. Rinsing it off after every use is neccessary. Therefore I took it upon myself to use it in the shower, being careful to park it on a ledge that is not in the line of any overspray. Then when I am done with my massage, I mean brushing, :-) I give it a quick rinse, holding it straight up, so the business end is not getting force fed. I haven't had any problems with it. I really like using it in the shower, makes me feel like it is a luxury massage for my teeth. I even renew the toothpaste application, to the head, for my lower teeth. The unique thing is that the head is vibrating so fast, that if you would take it out of your mouth in front of the mirror, you would have a clean up job to do afterwords. A zillion little bits of toothpaste would be splattered about. A problem that disappears when using it in the shower.The unit keeps a good charge. About once a week, I put it back int the charger. Interestingly, is that their isn't any of the usual metal contacts associated with a charger. The unit is sealed, as is the base. So when it is in the charger, it somehow moves through the plastic in the base into the charger without any direct metal contact. When the unit loses a charge, it tells you by flashing a light inside the on and off button. Takes the guesswork out of it.I had bought their kit with the multiple heads earlier. I just bought this unit for my mother as a gift.One last benefit that I want to mention, is that it enables you to get a really good brushing in areas of your mouth, that you may not brush as well due to accessability. Since the unit is doing all of the work, you no longer need a long staging area to get a sweeping motion going. You just place the Sonicaire on the spot, and the rapid pulsing, gives that area a great brushing.I have to admit, that when I got the unit at first, I thought, wow this thing is aggressive. I guess that is why the manufacturer programs it to go easy for the first couple of weeks, gradually building up to a full speed. After a while, it feels like normal brushing to you, and a standard brushing with a manual toothbrush seems like a poor excuse for the job.Get this Sonicaire toothbrush. You will be glad you did.

At first I noticed that it was too aggressive. My teeth and gums weren't used to it. I thought I had clean teeth, and would brush regularly. After visiting my dentist for a cleaning, the dental assistant razzed me about my gums bleeding when I flossed. She said that was due to bacteria. So I brushed and flossed, and used mouthwash, and that helped. Then I bought the Sonicaire toothbrush, and that made all the difference. Now when I floss, their isn't any blood, or at best an occassional little bit. This system really works.I had a tooth that was other than a few thin shell walls, down to my gumline. The dentist was able to save it, and install a crown. I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum. After using the Sonicaire system, my gums have healed and moved down so much that it is impossible for me to push them out of the way enought to feel that crown top anymore. When gums recede due to plaque and bacteria, that is when we get gingivitus, and even worse, periodontal disease, which results in having to remove the tooth. Do yourself a favor. A stitch in time truly saves nine. Buy this Sonicaire toothbrush system. You can not afford not to. It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.Now when I use it, their isn't even a little bit of discomfort. I even consider it a massage of sorts. I use it in the shower, even though the instructions tell you not to. I am careful not to submerge it, or get it too wet. You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow, so a quick rinse under the shower, keeping it held straight up, works great. I have had it for over 6 months, and the brush is still in like new shape.The kit comes with more than one brush head, which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house. If you are just using it for yourself, one head is enough. It is a savings to buy this kit though, because the multiple heads are a bargain over purchasing them individually. In the long run you will need a new head.Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength. Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.I have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis, is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well. With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you. If  you have a parent like that, this makes a great gift.Even if you are just buying it for yourself, buy it, and have the toughest gums, and brightest teeth on the block. I am sorry that I wasn't able to have one of these for all time.

I explained it was my Sonic tooth brush.  She complimented me at every six month visit.

I imagine he would have loved the shaver  (see separate review for the Norelco 6826XL), but that at some point he'd have sung a dramatic aria about the need to semi-regularly change your blades.It's easy to neglect changing the blades, as the Norelco works wonderfully and the deterioration is imperceptible at first. But after about 2 years on the SAME SET OF BLADES the performance is noticeably worse.  This neatly packaged replacement set is easy to use  (but try to keep the two part razor head and blade together as you place them in the shaver), the price seems reasonable, and it shaves again as if it were new: fast, smooth, close.

This brush has both rotary in and in-out pulsation. This is the combination that is better than rotary-only and that studies show gives better results.2. The replacement heads have an indicator that shows wear (the bristles become white. When the decolorization on the bristles is down to about 1/8 inch, it's time to change the head.)3. There is a timer to let you know you have brushed 2 minutes (recommended brushing time.)4. It does feel like \"after the dentist cleaned\" if you go the whole 2 minutes.Minus Points1. If you don't recharge according to the manufacturer's recommendation initially, you will not have a long battery life.2. The manufacturer doesn't make this entirely clear, but you should run the charge DOWN on the brush, then recharge, for maximum life. If you don't do this, you could experience a short life-span on this toothbrush. This happened to someone I know; the company made good on the guarantee and sent a replacement.3. If you DO let the charge run down, the brush is not so vigorous at the end and it seems a bit wimpy to do a really good job near the tag-end of the battery charge.4. You should go the 2 minutes for effective use, but who likes to stand there, spitting foam and grimacing in the mirror for that length of time?5. You should use it gently or you can scratch your gums.6. The replacement heads are a bit expensive.Despite the minus points, I rate this toothbrush five stars because I love how my teeth feel and it makes flossing afterwards better because I seem to have less tartar buildup.

My previous brush was the Oral B \"Cross Action\" AA battery powered brush. Until I used the 1000, I was satisfied with the Cross-Action. It was a good brush using a single battery and the brush heads were fairly good quality being Oral B.But now there's no going back. Honestly, I would not have purchased it - had it been selling at its former retail cost of over $80, but since my daughter is a manager at a local CVS, I was an early bird for the clearance - and sprang for the $22. So looking here at Amazon to see what others paid and what they think of this model prompted me to write my two cents worth in the form of a review.The motor is comparatively very quiet, yet obviously powerful. The cleaning result is superb, and noticeably improved over my former brush. The brush heads do seem tougher so far as the expected life and the dual action head is my personal fav.  My teeth feel noticeably smoother and gums more massaged. Tongue cleaning with the brush is very thorough as well. A good toothpaste will accent itself using this brush.Personally, I find the timer to be a slight nuisance more than a feature. I agree that over brushing - like applying too much pressure - is bad. But when I'm brushing, I don't like the nanosecond interruption of the motor frequency change - however-minor. But that's just me.Other reviewers commented about the battery, as if it's \"a negative\" feature. Admittedly, it would be better if it was Lithium-Ion, but then its cost would have been even higher.However, being a Ni-MH battery pack - it is an improvement over the older Ni-Cad type. It has more capacity and cannot be over-charged by the included charger. The owners manual is very clear to point this out and even instructs to discharge it fully every (6) months to maintain optimum power, duty cycle, and battery life. I don't think that is a negative, just the proper care for a device using this type of battery. Those interested could consult Wikipedia on NiMH batteries for a better scoop. Personally, I have not noted any degraded operation whatsoever in constantly charging mine all times when not being used, (and I doubt anyone else would either - for years).The only negative I see is the price for the replacement brush heads. Hopefully, being made more aware of the cautions stated against over-pressure and over-brushing will also yield longer brush head life. The pricing seems outrageous. The cost for the better brush heads OTC @CVS was $26 for a(3) pack. Amazon lists them for less, but they are as much or more after shipping is applied.

I have tried a variety of razors over the years.  Because of my prominent Adam's apple, it was very hard for me to find an electric shaver that felt comfortable.  The Panasonics and the Norelcos always irritated my neck area.  That was even after using them exclusively for several weeks.  Fortunately for me, I found this Braun.  I have been using this for two years.  So far, it has performed very well.  The Panasonic Wet/Dry gave a closer shave.  But it also irritated my skin the most.  The Norelco that I had before also shaved very close.  But I had a hard time shaving my neck area with it.  So, I finally gave the Braun Syncro a try.  After a while, I started getting the most comfortable shave ever from an electric.The shaver itself would get 5 stars.  However, the cleaning system that came with it is a bit expensive to maintain.  The cleaning cartridges that the cleaning system uses can get expensive.  I suggested to Braun that perhaps they should sell a reusable plastic cartridge, along with a liter (or 2) of the cleaning fluid in bulk bottle.  The consumer could simply empty the plastic cartridge and then refill with fluid.  That would save the consumer quite a lot.

Kline \"art & technology\"", "helpful": [15, 15], "reviewText": "The Braun Synchro System line consists of several models: 7570, 7546, 7526, and 7505. The top of the line is, naturally, the 7570. I suggest you go to [...] to see the spec comparison, as this site does a good job of showing you the differences. In a nutshell, they ALL have the same motor and cut exactly the same. The differences are in the number of indicators (the 7570 has an LCD screen), some additional chrome trim, and the inclusion of the cleaning system (the 7505 comes without it).I chose the 7526. At the time I bought it, there was quite a price difference between the 7526 and the higher 7546 and 7570 models. The 7526 comes with the cleaning system, while the 7505 does not. Other than that, the 7526 simply has only one LED indicator to show the remaining charge, and no decorative chrome trim on the head. Quite frankly, I see no need to get the 7570 in order to see exactly how much charge I have left, how long the cleaning system has been running, or how many hours I've spent shaving! All models will show a flashing red light when the charge is low. At that point you have two shaves left. Simply plug it into the socket when you're done and in about an hour or two you are fully charged. How hard is that?Although I bought the 7526, the 7570 shaver is essentially the same unit, so this review will apply.Details on the shaver itself: The Synchro System has a new high speed motor, and I think it is the fastest one for a shaver under $200. I find I get a very close shave, when using traditional foil shaver techniques (see Epinions.com website). Also, a single charge seems adequate enough to operate the shaver for two weeks. The motor and battery are light weight, so this shaver is not heavy, and it fits nicely in your hand. Three usage settings are available: 1) pivoting head, 2) locked head, and 3) trimmer extension. I use all three at various times--once again, Braun thought this out very well. It is also fairly rugged, but the plastic can crack if dropped from 4' or more onto a hard tile surface.The cleaning system: I find this device very ingenious, for a variety of reasons. First, it really does clean the shaver well. Second, it isn't overbearingly loud. And third, it has indicators to show when cleaning and charging are done. The fourth is revenue. Braun was very clever about this. If men are only going to spend money once every two years on the foil and cutter block, how could they make more money? Well, this cleaning system is the key. If the cleaner is used the way Braun recommends, you end up replacing the cleaning cartridge every month. The smart thing to do is buy the \"value pack\", which brings the cost down to about $5 per cartridge. How do you know when to change it? Well, the cleaning system will tell you. It detects when there is a high amount of particles in the solution, or if the solution is too low to flow through, and will flash the red cartridge light while simply not running until you replace the cartridge. The cleaner unit itself is slightly big (about 12\" tall x 5\" round), so you may have a little difficulty finding a place for it. And don't think of bringing it with you when traveling! (You don't really need to clean everyday anyway).But, I found a trick that Braun will despise me for. You can minimize the use of the cleaning solution and save big $$$. How do you do this? Well first of all, after each shave I dump my \"whisker debris\" down the sink, like you would normally do with the Flex Integral. It doesn't take long--simply pop off the foil, tap it in the sink, blow on both sides of the cutter block, replace the foil, and you're done in 10 seconds. This reduces the number of particles in the cleaning solution. So, why use the cleaning system at all, you may ask? It does do an excellent job of cleaning the cutter block, and whisker dust that is stuck on it and within the head and foil holder. A tedious task, even once or twice a week. When do I use the cleaning system? Well, usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged. At this point, I take out the cartridge from my drawer, remove the top plugs, and slide it into the cleaner. Then I slide in the shaver and let the cleaner do its work. When the cleaning and charging is done, I remove the cleaning cartridge, reseal it with the plastic plugs, and put it away. This way the solution level does not get low from evaporation! Clever, eh? The only catch is that if you try to charge the shaver while mounted in the cleaner without the cartridge, it will not work. But you can always plug it in directly, without the cleaner. Anyway, that's my trick for getting around one this somewhat minor drawback. Some have said it's nice to have a \"clean\" shaver to use each time, but I find the cleaning process works well enough to use once per charge (just dump the whisker debris after each shave).If price is no object, get the 7570. Otherwise, I recommend getting the 7526 if you find it priced low enough below the 7546 and 7570.

I was a long time blade-only user.  Gillette's Mach 3 Turbo gave me the absolute closest shave I'd ever gotten when combined with Gillette Edge shaving gel.  My biggest problem - the blades price.  $15 for 4 tiny lil blades?  WAYYY too overpriced.  I must have spent about $120 on blades alone.I'd tried the rotary type and other of the in-line type of electric shavers.  The rotary kept snagging my hairs, and the inline didn't cut at all.  So I was a little apprehensive about going back.I'm an African American whose facial hair grows rapidly.  I find I have to shave twice a day.  As a working man, I often don't have time (and am too lazy) for that.  So I picked this up at Rite-Aid (who has it for $30 cheaper than Amazon).My first impression was that it felt very well put together, and smelled very nice.I need to put this up for the African Americans out there, because in order for this shaver to earn its keep, there are some things you need to do first, or it will not work.First, you need the right electric pre-shave cream.  I use Williams &quot;Lectric&quot; Pre Shave cream.  It makes the hairs very easy to shave.Second, you MUST shave with a razor the very first time.  Especially if you're prone to razor bumps.  The blade is designed to help get rid of the bumps.  If there's bumps, the foil will not cut close at all.  After you do the first shave with a razor, then use this for maintenance, and I guarantee you that it will do its job.Third, DO NOT wash your face beforehand; wash it after.  if you wash your face beforehand, the hairs soften and get harder to cut.  Since we have curly facial hair, it will naturally aim for your face instead of straight out.Fourth, after shaving, wash your face with a good face wash, like Clearasil or something.  IT will clear off the dirt, oil, pre-shave, hairs, and everything else.Fifth, finish everything off with a good aftershave.Once you've done all of that, use the razor as a routine.  I use it twice a day, I clean it once every two days.  There's no need to use the cleaner EVERY day; that's how you run out of fluid fast.  In fact, I just use a compressed air can (keyboard cleaner) to clean between the blades.  Works just fine for me.I have about 5 more steps to my routine.  Here's what I do (to make sure my face is the ultimate snooth it can be):- preshave lotion- shave with electric shaver- wash with Clearasil Daily Face Wash- quick Stridex pad over shaved area (dries out any remaining oil)- all over astringent (I use Sea Breeze) until there's no dirt on the cotton ball- all over Clarifying Toner (makes sure my skin tone remains consistent, I use Clean &amp; Clear)- aftershave (I use Gillette)I know it's a lot, but my face looks strides better when I go the distance like that.  I could always half it and just do the minimum, but my face doesn't look anywhere near as good as when I do all of it.

This meant I had to shave 4 times a day.  The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful, and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.I've been a solid Braun customer ever since. Unfortunately, while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool, Gillette (the owner of the Braun brand for several years) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts.  The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy, the 7000FC replacement combo isn't.  After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use, the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes.  These end up giving you nasty, painful small cuts.  The cutter too wears down a bit.  I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30% less time and is generally closer.  Well worth buying.One other note.

Now I had thought of about a dozen ways that I could save money on these cartridges including resealing them between uses and/or just refilling old cartridges.  However, after two months of use, I pulled my old cartridge out to find that it really did clean the dang razor in between uses.  The leftover solution was brown and had obviously been used even though it still smelled good.  I tried rinsing it out to no avail, so I just tossed it out and put in a new cartridge.Now I think that's certainly telling us something.  These bad boys work.  I bought a self-cleaning razor simply because I hate cleaning them, and I think that this one really fits the bill.  When I bought my razor, I did the math to determine that even a high end Braun electric would be, in the long run, more cost effective than using a blade.  That was based on using one of these cleaning solutions every month.

This cartridge will fit even the early model Syncros, all the way to the latest Pulsonics.I have not tried any of the newer Braun models, as my 7-year-old Syncro is still going strong.  However, be assured that they all use the same cleaning cartridge, even though the newer models have an improved cleaning stand.The cleaning system works great.  It cleans, dries, and lubricates the razor.  However, bear in mind that the cleaner is alcohol-based.  Meaning it will eventually evaporate.  It starts to evaporate as soon as you open the seal.  Each cartridge will last approximately one month.  So your cost to keep your razor clean and lubricated, automatically, works out to about five dollars every month.  That's not so bad, considering that shaving with a blade will cost you money in hot water use, shaving cream, and replacement blades.  I would say that perhaps the electric razor might come out cheaper.  You can be like me and simply clean your razor manually.  That's even more cost-effective.  But still, it is nice to be able to simply use your razor, place it in the cleaning stand, and then have it ready for you the next day, with no effort on your part.If you have a Braun cleaning system and you want to use it, this is your only option.

I won't ever go back to a blade even if it does shave more closely, I just can't stand to think that I'm just a sneeze away from a free face peel.Before Braun came up with this cash cow I was cleaning my Braun with a toothbrush every 2-3 shaves. I still do that about once a month because even though the fluid cleans the cutting blade you still get hair detritus left behind in cracks, outside of the foil assembly and even around the two screws under the cutting block and other places. So once in a while, I'll get out my trusty toothbrush again and give the whole shaver a thorough cleaning over.This fluid is not cheap so I try to prolong the life span of it by \"pre-cleaning\" my shaver. I always open up the shaver and tap away the loose hair cuttings after every shave. This way, the cleaner fluid stays cleaner longer. And everyone is right, I don't think there's any way of preventing the fluid from evaporating, LOL, I think Braun made sure of that. Just make sure you don't park your cleaner in a hot area.Taking the advice of some the other reviewers, when I'm done with the cleaning, I remove the cleaning fluid and cap it to prevent further evaporation. The instructions say the fluid should normally last 1 month. By removing the cleaning fluid and capping it, I'm able to have it last 6 weeks even with cleaning the shaver after every use. But I would not recommend using it longer than that because dead bacteria and other things I'd rather not think about is going to remain in the cleaner fluid reservoir, and the cleaner fluid gets more concentrated and dirty. As another reviewer says, it's about $5 per month, which is not bad to have your shaver smelling good and clean. And it's certainly good for Braun!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice smell, and I'm lazy.", "unixReviewTime": 1205712000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2008"}

However, there are a couple of things to think about:Braun's manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day.  In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can't detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day.You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  But what's the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?There are two bits of bad news.  First is the cost.  These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you'll spend about $60 per year.  That's just the way it goes.  You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  Whatever you put in won't have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.Another bit of bad news is the mess.  You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.

The Clean & Renew cartridges are wonderfully convenient as they both clean and lubricate the shaver head in one step (the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger over the shaver head after each cleaning). The cleaning also leaves a fresh lemon scent.Now, the convenience comes at a price. The price of the Clean & Renew cartridges is definitely a concern for a lot of people, including myself. There are, however, a few things you can do to economize:(1) remove the cartridge and cap it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile alcohol component, or (2) if that's too much of a hassle, top of the cartridge with 91-99% isopropyl alcohol when the fluid runs low. (3) don't run the shaver through the cleaning cycle after *every* shave; do it only after several shaves (note: Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF). (4) if you're really strapped for cash, you always have the option of cleaning the shaver head under running tap water! Just remember to lube the shaver head periodically with amachine oil.I absolute love these Clean & Renew cartridges!

The shaver gets super clean and smells great after a cleaning session.2. The cleaning solution also lubricates the shaver thus increasing life.3. The solution lasts about 2x as long as I thought it would.I started using the shaver around March 7. I shave 2 times a day thanks to a super heavy beard that grows super fast. I have a 6 oclock shadow at 10:00am... So, I tried to use the cleaning solution once a day but ended up using it twice a day (I shave in the morning and at night). Just today (April 9 2008) the low light came on. That means 1 cleaning cartridge lasts a little over a month with 2 cleanings per day for me.One thing I do that may help the life is after every single shave I take off the head - blow out the shaver and put the head under the faucet for 2-3 seconds. I know, why do this when you have a dedicated cleaning system, right? Well, for a $220 shaver, I'll do whatever I want. lol. Washing out the shaver head may have extended the life of the solution - I've seen this in other reviews as well.Sign up for the subscription and the price will go down 15%.

I wish, as others who have reviewed this, that they would package up the fluid and let you just refill the plastic cartridges.  It's probably the only negative I see with this razor after a couple years of use.  I will say though that it does do the job nicely.  I've run out of liquid and used the razor for a few days without cleaning and I could feel a difference.  Hence the title of my review, it's the price that prompted me to give 3 stars, not the performance.  It does it's job nicely.

The problem with owning a Clean & Renew (or \"Clean & Charge\") system is that refills like this cost yet more money for a razor you already bought the Clean & Charge system for, and for which you also know that you'll be buying blades and foils.Here then are the best ways to save money when you're buying Clean & Renew refills:- This product can be bought two ways:  as a pack of three or a pack of two. The price of each changes from time to time.  When you need to buy more, take a moment's basic math to figure out the best price per unit.  Sometimes the per-unit price of three is a better deal than the price for just two, and vice versa.- You don't need to use this system every day, or even every week.  I bought my system from a Braun store that also did repairs and the owner (who also owned a 7526 like mine) told me he uses the cleaner every two weeks.  He also said...- When using your Braun razor daily, take 10 seconds when you're done and run it with the foil clicked loose (but still attached).  The blade inside will shake like a wet dog and drop loose particles into your trash or sink...meaning less build-up when you go to put it in the clean and charge...and the fluild lasts longer- When you're not using the clean & charge system, pop open the Clean & Charge base, slide out the Clean & Renew refill, and put the cap back on it.  This will keep the alcohol from evaporating and the fluid will last longer.- This product is often eligible for free Super Saver shipping if you buy more than $25.  Either buy two three-packs and get free shipping, or buy these when you need to buy a blade and/or foil replacement (which are also often eligible for free Super Saver Shipping).  It doesn't make sense to pay $5 to ship a $10 or $15 item.  I typically buy a set of these when I'm on my last one, and usually only when I happen to be buying something else that'll push me over the limit and save me some money.I like the Braun Clean & Charge system, and my Braun 7526.  I don't like being nickel-and-dimed on all the bits and pieces that keep it working as well as it does.

Most families have an oral thermometer and some use other types, like rectal or those that are placed under the armpit. These other thermometers are generally ok with certain age groups but when it comes to the very young, an ear thermometer is the best option. And the Braun IRT 4520 is one of the best on the market.This thermometer gives accurate results in about 30 to 45 seconds. They way it accomplishes its task is by using infrared technology to measure the level of heat generated by the eardrum and other tissue. Some may question the ear as an accurate place to measure ones' body temperature but according to many medical experts, the ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral and other types of thermometers.Of all the pluses with this device, the most important among them is the ease of use. Babies generally don't like anything placed inside their ears but they don't resist this type of thermometer like they do others. I had tried using the armpit style thermometer but the squirming and crying was too much. With this, there is still a little bit of annoyance for both your baby and you but it is nothing compared to the aggravation caused by other types of thermometers.On occasion, this thermometer may have a problem producing an accurate measurement and when it does, it will let you know on the display panel. For example, if the tip isn't inserted properly in the ear, you will get the error code \"POS\", indicating that the positioning is not secure. If the surrounding air is too hot or too cold (needs to be between 50 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit), you will get the \"Err\" error message. If a person's temperature is far too high or too low, (outside the 93.2 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit range) you will get \"HI\" or \"LO\". If this happens, don't panic- chances are you didn't insert the thermometer correctly or the filter isn't clean. Replace the filter if necessary and try again.One of the many nice things about this device is that it comes complete with batteries. This may not seem like a big deal but it is no fun when you buy a new electronic device, race home, and discover you forgot the batteries. Braun knows that when people buy a thermometer, it is usually because they need to use it immediately. They don't want the unexpected surprise of having no batteries. Braun includes these for your convenience. And the fact that the batteries are ordinary AA is also convenient because this type of battery is easy to find.Yet another plus with this thermometer is that it stores the last temperature in memory. This temperature will display when you turn the unit on, allowing you to see the last reading and compare it to the reading you are about to take. This is nice because it takes the guesswork out of the task. Often, a pediatrician will ask if you know the previous temperature so that he/she can make comparisons and check progress in the case of illness. With this device, it is right there, on the panel when you turn it on. And when you take a new temperature, the reading remains on the screen for sixty seconds for your convenience.Could this thermometer be improved in any way? Well, I can only think of a few minor things. One would be a gripping surface- perhaps a small section around the middle with a rubber covering to help consumers hold the device more firmly in place. Another possible improvement would be a lighted display panel, just in case you need to use the thermometer in a dark place. These and other changes could make the thermometer even more appealing, but they are minor and shouldn't count for much in a buying decision.To keep things as sanitary as possible, it is important to always replace the lens filter before each use. This is a small plastic cap that fits over the tip of the measuring device and it needs to be replaced after each use. These replacement filters can be purchased in most drug stores and on- line at a cost of less then ten dollars for a pack of forty. This is an added cost for owning this type of thermometer. But any type of thermometer is going to include its share of cleaning/sanitation costs so, again, this shouldn't have too much affect on one's decision to buy.Overall, this thermometer has proven itself a godsend for me and my family. The ease of use, the memory storage of the last temperature reading, and the long battery life (about two years or 1000 measurements) make this a must have for anyone with babies or toddlers. It eliminates much of the fussiness and frustration common with other thermometers and even though it carries a hefty price tag, it is worth the extra cost.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy Temperature- Taking Device", "unixReviewTime": 1144972800, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2006"}

Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she's one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that's a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you're only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The 'ease of use' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself.

First of all, the sounds are poorly done in that they repeat on a very short loop and do not sound natural, especially: brook and spring rain. The ocean is a recording of one wave that repeats with a drip at the end which is more annoying than relaxing. The white noise option sounds like a TV that has been left on while the station went off the air.Secondly, the machine will only run for either 15, 30 or 60 minutes then shuts off automaticly. For someone who needs to have the noise run the entire time they sleep, this machine is useless.Thirdly, the aroma option is noisy to run and drowns out the selected sounds. The basket where you put the aroma beads vibrates and rattles which is another annoyance when trying to fall asleep. The scent is barely detectable unless you have the machine right under your nose. I even tried soaking a pad with essential oil, that works better than the scent beads that comes with the machine.I did give this two stars because if someone only wants the machine to run for 1 hour, and only wants to listen to white noise then this will work as long as you don't want the scent to go along with the noise. It does have volume adjustment, but I prefer just to leave the thing turned off. It was not expensive, but I do feel I wasted my money.My suggestion is to get a CD of ocean waves or nature sounds instead and to soak a cotton ball in essential oil and place it in a dish.

In addition to the reason that made me an inpatient, I had developed quite a red, itchy rash \"down there.\"  The (male) nurse gave me a little dose-cup of cream and a wooden coffee stick and suggested I apply it to myself after showering.  Recognizing the familiar smell and thickness of the cream as some version of Monistat, I asked, \"Why this?  I don't have a vagina.\"  The nurse, who was not easily shocked, replied \"Similar condition.  Hot, wet, anaerobic (oxygen-free).  Just use it.\"I did, and it worked--to a point.  But why, I asked myself, hadn't someone thought of taking one of the many athletic powders on the market and making Miconazole Nitrate (as in Monistat) its active ingredient?  That would combine a proven antifungal agent with the dryness and absorbent quality of an athletic powder. Several years later I was delighted to find this Zeabsorb type AF on drugstore shelves, and it has been a mainstay for my torrid zone every since.It's a simple combination but it works well for me: the powder dries, and the Miconazole Nitrate fights fungus.  It works great against my crotch rotch or any impending versions thereof.  It also keeps my summer armpits from getting \"withery,\" if you should be annoyed by that condition.  Since it is a fine enough powder to fight friction, it is refreshing and comfortable on the guy bits themselves, especially worn with summer cotton. Personally, it's just okay on my feet, not much better than original Desenex or even Gold Bond green label, but for simplicity's sake it has become my all-over, take-with powder. (Note that it is marketed as a remedy against athlete's foot.)  Be sure, when you buy this, to look for the wasp-waisted plastic bottle with the green strip in the middle; other reviewers have stressed that similar-looking products don't work as well.  Not everyone will warm to the smell, which is basically locker-room medicinal, slightly sweet.  Certainly it has the advantages of not smelling of kid stuff like baby powders, nor like menthol, but not SO macho people can smell you half a block away.  \"Get me some of that s--- that don't stink,\" said Kevin Costner's baseball player in the movie BULL DURHAM, and perhaps he had something like Zeabsorb in mind.Typically, Zeabsorb AF is not cheap, with a price at the premium end of mass-distribution powders.  I ordered the two-pack for sale here at Amazon, for a savings of about 25 percent per bottle compared to my local Walmart, roughly 40 percent less than at Walgreen's.  The bottles were shrink-wrapped together, put in a clear protective bag, and then boxed with air bladders--flawless.  I am sorry some reviewers here had problems with different versions of Zeabsorb than they bargained for, or poor packaging; hopefully those problems have been addressed.  Certainly I am pleased with my experience.  Also, thus far, this is NOT an add-on item, a plus with me.If you haven't tried Zeabsorb AF yet, I recommend it, but I do realize the choice of an antifungal powder like this is somewhat subjective.  Personally, I know of no good substitute for the powder for personal use, and the price at Amazon as of now can't be beat.

If it were, it would have the word VapoInhaler as one word on the side.  My review pertains ONLY to REAL VICKS Products.  Please keep in mind that Vicks sublicenses out their design and basic ingredient list in foreign countries.  If it doesn't say VAPOINHALER on the side, it is likely a Grey marekt product.  I have checked around with a lot of other sinus sufferers and even with VICKS and they say that if the product does NOT say VapoInhaler on it - it ain't there's and that they do NOT manufacture in India but when I asked if they sublicensed, the lady didn't know.  Wikipedia states:  \" Levomethamphetamine is a sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor which is the active ingredient used in some over-the-counter nasal decongestants including the US formulation of Vicks Vapor Inhaler, but not the Canadian or Indian formulations, which contain only menthol and camphor.\"  So... if it doesn't smell right or look right, call Amazon and alert them that you are being sold counterfeit goods or grey market goods.Here's my review of the REAL Vick's VapoInhale as formulated here in the USA and apparently only for sale at Walmarts these days:The design of the USA Vicks Inhalor is one of the reasons it is so popular.  No bigger than a chapstick, you can carry it anywhere.  The two primary ingredients are the reliable Vicks Vapors and another medicine, L-Desoxyephedrine (vicks chooses to call it \" Levmetamfetamine\" )which can show up on some drug tests as an Amphetamine.  That's why you should keep the card that it comes attached to in the event that your employer tests you shortly after you've used it.  it's not considered terribly habit forming, but you shouldn't use it all the time.  You're getting a tiny dose of stimulant each time you inhale and that is what shrinkes your swollen nasal passages.The medications in the inhalor are very powerful and you should follow the instructions carefully.  Inhaling it more frequently than directed can cause nasal irritation.  This is a good product to have on hand when you need something to blast through serious stuffiness.  It's a good thing to use if you are so stuffed up that you can't even get nasal spray up you nostril.  Clear your congestion temporarily with this and THEN apply nasal spray.Make sure you keep the cap screwed on tightly and keep the inhalor out of the heat.  Don't leave in you car where it can heat up. If it's heated up drastically, it can cause irritation since the vapors will be stronger.  Just like a nasal spray, you should not use this for more than a few days.A good product that can help you out when others don't work.  A nice alternative to oral decongestants.  Update 4/6/2014 - I have not been able to find the real deal in a USA Drugstore, grocery store or mass market retailer for almost a year now and use Kroger Branded Vapor Inhalers instead with good results.  I spent $20 buying something that looked like the item in the above photo and  they were obvious grey market or counterfeit goods.  the real Vicks product says VapoInhaler all as one word. The Kroger Brand is only $2.99 each and works very well, so that's what my wife uses these days.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Convenient  But beware the FAKES from INDIA - Make sure the package reads Vicks VapoInhaler and not just Vicks Inhaler!", "unixReviewTime": 1139616000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2006"}

Don't spend your summer worrying about embarrassing, underarm sweat stains! Instead, get 72-hour sweat protection from Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant. Both the roll-on and solid provide triple the 24-hour promise of other clinical strength antiperspirants at a fraction of the cost! Just apply it, forget it and raise your arms in confidence for 72-hours. One of you lucky readers will have a chance to win their choice of the roll-on or solid!I haven't used a roll on antiperspirant in quite a while so I wanted to change things up a bit. I normally don't sweat a lot. Of course if I'm doing a lot of work or out in the heat it can be expected. So I went ahead and gave this a go to see how it would affect me. First of all you should note that there are no smells or scents of any kind coming from the roll on. I love things that smell good, but this is great for those with allergies or can't handle scented items. Regardless of that, the deodorant does it's job. It applies clear without any coloration and dries quickly -- remember, I have the roll-on, not the solid. I can tell you that I've noticed a difference in just a few days of using it. No excessive sweating while at work! I've experienced no irritations, rash, or itching either. Definitely another plus! If you were to look at the ratings and reviews on Amazon, you would also notice they have a 4.5 out of 5 stars rating. Very impressive!Needless to say I've had a wonderful experience. Certain Dri is high quality and best of all -- it works! The customer service I received was very friendly and quick to respond to any questions. Based off of not only my reviews, but other reviews, I would definitely recommend this product to someone in need of an underarm sweat stain fighter! Not to mention it is a low cost product.

I also just tried DEGREE clinical Strength products and they were absolutely worthless. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DEGREE CLINICAL STRENGTH.Tired of the excess sweating and pit stains on all my white shirts, I heard about Botox for sweating, so I checked it out on the web and then the add popped up for Certain Dry. At $5 or $6 a box, I figured who cares, I'd give it a try first. After all, I've spent hundreds of dollars on experimental methods I saw in the back of magazines, so why not another 6 bucks.I purchased Certain Dry about two weeks ago and it worked instantly. I now wear it every other day and recently went out in a gray t-shirt. I couldn't believe that I passed the GRAY T-SHIRT test IMMEDIATELY. When I say immediately, I mean the very next day.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. I applied it as directed on the box; at night like a deodorant roll on. It does not run at all and dries pretty quickly (about 2-3 minutes). I have gone 48 hours between applications and I still remain dry, so I assume it will last 72 hours, but haven't tried. Also, I have NOT experienced any irritation, just some minor itching for a few minutes after application but this goes away quickly and well worth it.I only wrote this review to be helpful because I know what it is like to be be embarrased by EXTREME SWEATING and I think you should give it a try.

I've tried a dozen different regular antiperspirants and none could quite match my expectations and they all left me frustrated and disappointed, as well as with yellow aluminum stains on my shirts. Then I found Certain Dri and thought I would give it a chance after hearing about it from a friend and how well it works. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to dryness, redness, and flaking, and so I went with what was recommended by the manufacturer itself: Certain Dri Solid stick.I began with the solid stick application at night this past winter in an effort to stop my unprovoked dampness under my arms. It took almost 3 weeks with the stick for me to notice any real results, and at the same time I had been using a regular antiperspirant (Old Spice, Mitchum) in the morning. For about 4-5 months things seemed to work alright. I definitely felt like I sweat less under my arms but there would always seem to be an obnoxious dew that would show up mid-day even though I wasn't doing anything physically demanding nor was I anxious or nervous. Finally, the day came where I was thoroughly fed up and decided to go against my hesitation and give Certin Dri Roll-On a try. At this point I was so frustrated I didn't care about any stinging or redness or any of the other stories you can read about; I just wanted to stop feeling uncomfortable throughout the day.Enter Certain Dri Roll-On . . . after my first night's application of 2 strokes/underarm, I noticed an improvement the next day; it seemed to be working better than the solid stick ever worked for me. No stinging, no itching, no redness, no rash - no apparent side-effects other than what is intended. I kept up with my 2 stroke routine and after a week and a half of nightly use I noticed a dramatic improvement. After going out that day I noticed I had experienced absolutely no sweating during times when I normally would have sweat.I have been keeping with this routine for 2 weeks now and I feel better than ever. I don't feel like I'm sweating for no reason anymore and I don't have that insufferably uncomfortable dampness under my arms I would get from just sitting still. I put onOld Spice Classic Deodorant , Original Scent, 3.25-Ounces (Pack of 6)(no more yellow aluminum stains for me) in the morning after my shower and I am all set for the entire day. I've yet to cut back to trying every other day with the Certain Dri for fear of my sweating returning, but I will soon give it a go. Either way, I couldn't be more pleased with my results.As far as any stinging, itching, or burning goes: *read and follow the directions carefully* - DO NOT apply Certain Dri after showering or shaving your underarms. Use it sparingly - I understand the temptation to really coat your pits in an effort to eradicate your sweat glands, but trust me - less is more with this stuff: 2 strokes max. I've been using the roll-on every night for 2 weeks now and I haven't had a single instance of any sort of irritation or redness. The most I've felt was a mild itch one night which disappeared after 20 minutes. The applicator itself could be a problem for men with hairy armpits... The ball rolls against your skin and can catch your armpit hairs and pull on them or even yank them out, but really this is hardly more than a tiny pinch and if you trim or shave your pits you obviously won't have this issue.Be aware that everyone's body is different so everyone's body will react differently to this product. If you get a rash: stop use and give the solid stick a try (it may work better for you personally as the active ingredient is a different in both).Finally: HAVE PATIENCE - as I mentioned above I only saw dramatic results and the virtual elimination of my excess sweating after a week and a half of nightly application. I almost gave up entirely after a few days before dedicating myself to sticking to it and it paid off.In conclusion, if you suffer from excessive perspiration or hyperhidrosis, definitely give this product a try. I'd recommend buying it from Walmart where I purchased it for about $4.70. I am extremely pleased with this product's performance after an initial waiting period and I only hope it doesn't fail me like the solid did. A confidence-saver product all around.-----*****10/6/12 UPDATE*****A quick update just to report that Certain Dri Roll-On has been working fantastically since I wrote this review. My excessive perspiration has been eliminated and I can feel comfortable going out without having to worry about sweating uncontrollably and unprovoked.

That means I have had it so long that no one knew what I had as a baby, but I was regulated to Goat's milk and Karo syrup and water and evaporated milk on some kind of rotating schedule that drove everyone nuts. Mostly, it gave me a great dislike for milk, and I grew up anyway. I just did not drink milk.On sleepover's, my mom sent a note saying I was allergic and I could have Lemonade, Kool-Ade or Coke instead. It was a great way to avoid milk, but played hob with my teeth which had more than their fair share of cavities.I don't remember exactly when Lactaid  came on the market. I did not know anyone else who was Lactose Intolerant until After it was out. Back in the 60's one did NOT talk about anything that one had that was \"Different.\" Not drinking milk fell into that category. So, when I saw Lactaid on the shelf at the pharmacy, I gave it a try. Wow! I could eat ice cream, drink shakes, down yoghourt, and guzzle a glass of 4% milk if I were so inclined. All I had to do was chew the proper number of tablets, generally one, prior to imbibing anything with Lactose in in and my stomach behaved itself as long as I followed the directions on the box.For me Lactaid is a phamaceutical miracle. Finally, at an age somewhere close to God's, or, at least over 60, I can drink a Chocolate Malt with the best of them. My favorite is Sonic with an extra scoop of chocolate and an extra scoop of malt. Heaven on earth.I have no negatives about this product. I follow the directions. It works. I get to have chocolate malts for breakfast. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who is dx with Lactose Intolerance or who suspects they may have it. It is inexpensive and works as directed.

We tested positive and didn't think to retest. Turns out, we were pregnant! We saved the second one to use again later.We recently used that second one and jumped with joy again when we got a positive result. I called my mom. I called my mother-in-law, I told all my friends that we were going to almost have &#34;Irish Twins&#34;--when your babies are about a year apart (my other baby was four months old when we took this test). I made an iron on onesie for my four-month-old that had a photo of an owl and read, &#34;Guess who's going to be a big sister?&#34; and paraded my daughter around town so proudly and excitedly.Then, my husband in his infinite wisdom suggested that we take a second test...several days after I'd already done considerable online shopping and filled my Amazon cart with a double stroller, second crib, second carseat, and other baby essentials.Well, that second test was a different brand and it was negative.So I rushed out to CVS and bought another pack of First Response tests. One of the two new First Response tests was positive.I went to the Dollar Store and got a handful of cheap tests. Half of those were positive. Half were negative.I went to the hospital and got a blood test--negative.First Response wasn't the only test that gave me a &#34;false positive&#34;--every brand did. The problem was that I didn't know about the evaporation line...the little line that shows up after the ten-minute mark, indicating that you're pregnant. It tends to happen more with blue-line tests, apparently. But it happened with 2/3 First Response pink tests for me.Moral of the story: Only read the test within the timeframe indicated on the packaging. Not before--not after.These tests are easy to use and the cap is great for blocking contact with your urine when you run into your mom's/husband's/mother-in-law's/friend's excited arms and hand her your test to show her how pregnant you are!

I started looking at reviews for the cheaper test strips and more expensive digital monitors.  There were some concerns about accuracy for both of these when compared to OPK sticks, and I have come to the conclusion that I'm going to \"stick\" with these for several reasons:1) Accuracy.  I can tell when my body is ovulating (I get that I just want to jump out of my skin moody feeling of just wanting to bite my husband's head off, irritability, middle achyness, etc.).  When I test these strips against my own experiences they are dead on.  Some of the reviews have stated that they are inaccurate based on having a faded line one day, and nothing the next, and this is my experience except when you stick with it.  I did eventually get a positive result with two dark lines.  Reading it can be tricky at first but you eventually get the hang of it.  I'm not a doctor, but I have read that the ovaries put out progesterone in \"pulses\" and it gradually builds in your system.  If the ovaries are also putting out estrogen and LH, this could operate the same way, hence getting a faded line one day, nothing the next, a few days later faded line, and then boom!...the double dark lines.  Note that LH may stay in your system for a couple of days.  I did a little experiment this month and found that I got double lines 3 days in a row, and the fourth day a faded line.  So, the more you can test (and listen to your body) to catch the LH surge the better.2) I love the convenience of using these.  I'm not a person that likes a mess, so you can pee in a cup, dip it in for a few seconds and then take it out, put on the plastic cap and wait.  I don't enjoy putting my pee on the counter, so this is really nice.  Also, if you cannot wait for the results you can take it with you.  I have done this a few times, especially when traveling.  I used one in the airport bathroom (took a dixie cup with me) and presto!3) My only complaint is the expense.  I've paid anywhere between $14-19 in a store for 7 strips plus a pregnancy test.  This can get pricey if you test a couple times a day like I do.  I wish they sold a bulk package.All in all, I want something that is accurate and these seem to do the trick.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Expensive but pretty darn good....", "unixReviewTime": 1342569600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2012"}

King", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "When you need a band-aid in a particularly mobile place, all-around adhesive is important.  That's only one advantage of these band-aids. I have used these in the crook of my arm, on my wrist and the base of my thumb.  I've gotten them wet and scratched over them without thinking and I haven't had one come off by accident.  In addition, I have very sensitive skin that is often irritated by bandage adhesive.  I have no problem with these.  The water block feature works well for me and is a big help on my hands especially.At the moment I have a bit of poison ivy from some brush clearing and don't want it to spread so I covered the various spots with band-aids.  The only places that have stayed reliably covered were those with these band-aids over them.  The strips that have open sides where the pad is tend to buckle or snag on something and get pulled at least partially off.  Once such a strip is dislodged a bit, you might as well just replace it as it will be annoying and will eventually come all the way off.  One such place that was too big for coverage with the Water Block Plus strips was covered with such a band-aid and I scratched it off in the night, where the nearby spot covered with the Water Block Plus band-aid stayed completely secure.  My fingernails went over and across it but didn't dislodge it at all.Since I needed different sizes to cover my various rash spots, I got down my collection of band-aids and used whichever fit rather than because I needed the other features, anti-bacterial, waterproof or whatever, so I have a variety on at one time.  These, the Water Block Plus ones, are the best and most reliable of all.  I didn't intend to do this band-aid comparison test :) but having done so, I will now stock up on this particular kind.

It was very difficult to remove, and then I noticed my skin was numb where the band-aid had been.  Some days later that skin peeled off and now my skin is back to normal.I would like to avoid this type of band-aid, but since every type of band-aid comes in the identical wrapper it is difficult to tell which type I have.  Some types don't stick too well and others stick too much.  All in the same wrapper.  Why not color code the wrappers so we could know and remember which type works for us?Over the years we have seen different band-aid types, none of which seem as good as the original which would stick on for days, without being too sticky, or harmful to the skin.Band-aid seems to change for the sake of change, without real improvement. BTW- can any band-aid be opened without simply tearing the wrapper for instance?Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any competition, and therefore, evidently not a real effective band-aid.Update 9/24/2013 - I just found that Kroger now has a bandage, [sheer bandages], that stays on for at least some washings, come off without coming apart, and don't numb your skin.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poor and Inconsistent quality", "unixReviewTime": 1327708800, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2012"}

That said, I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand, I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers, to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also, the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic, so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.

I use these with complete satisfaction and I can tell you why.The assorted sizes in these boxes mean that different size band aids can be applied to different size wounds. After all, you wouldn't use a 1  inch by 4 inch band aid to cover a minor wound after a splinter has been removed, now would you? In this package you get smaller bandages that cover just the tiny areas--or the larger areas where you may have a cut from a knife while you were chopping onions or peppers or something.These bandages also offer an excellent feature: they stay on even when wet. Therefore the band aid can be applied to your skin wound much more effectively than a regular band aid.Two caveats: If your wound is really bad, seek out a doctor or even consider going to an emergency room if you believe the situation warrants it. You may also have to wash the wound area with soap and water before you apply the bandage if you think you need to do so. Moreover, Amazon also correctly notes that the product packaging contains latex--if this is a concern for you, you may want to choose another substitute product recommended by a physician.Overall, Band-Aid scores a huge plus in my book with these bandages.

I did not do it quite right and that resulted in an infection, which took several weeks to cure.  Here is the wound cleaning procedure that my doctor gave me along with the anti-biotic to cure the infection:1. Wash your hands thoroughly using plenty of soap and warm water.  Rinse and dry with clean towel.2. Assemble all of your supplies such as cleaning solutions so that you don't have to move or interrupt the procedure.3. Remove old dressing by loosening all of the tape. Pull all tape ends gently toward the wound so that you won't disturb the healing process by pulling the healing edges apart.4. When all tape is loosened remove all dressings, one layer at a time, and discard into plastic disposal bag.5. Pick up a mirasorb gauze sponge by one end and dip it into the cleansing solution recommended by your doctor.6. Clean wound by stroking gently in a circular motion. Do not scrub back and forth, especially across incision line.7. Repeat this process using clean sponge until entire wound is cleaned.8. Pat dry wound using a clean sponge.9.

Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn't matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective. My lips would flake and feel sore, uncomfortable, and dry, and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely. It was so annoying and distracting. No matter what I would be doing (working, cooking, reading etc) I would be constantly distracted by the discomfort of my chapped lips.The problem cropped up recently, and I tried everything this time -- Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar. None of these things worked. Dryness and discomfort would return in short order.So I googled for remedies and kept seeing recommendations for Aquapfor. I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing. Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable. I kept applying periodically, and by the next morning my lips were almost all healed. In about 24 hours my lips were essentially healed. This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.Petrolatum is 41% of the ingredients, but NO, this is not at all like Vaseline even though it may look and feel like it. I had tried both Vaseline and creamy Vaseline for my severely chapped lips, and neither made a difference. Aquaphor did. So don't believe the reviewers who say it is the same. The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).I also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well.

However, the Aquaphor brand contains other Inactive Ingredients listed as: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin and Bisabolol. The \"Store Brand\" lacks the last three I've listed in the Aquaphor Brand. The difference is quite shocking. Could this be why the store brand is such poor quality as compared to the Eucerin brand? I don't know, but I'll never buy store brand for this product again.Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand, otherwise you might find that you've saved a $1 on something that turns out to be a waste of money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Stuff Ever, just 1 tip...", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013"}

Once opened up via surgery, surgeons scrub out the rooms and pack them with antibiotics and pain medications.  I appreciate a GP recommending alternative useful medications, known to get results without surgery.  However, my first visit with this condition warranted faster action, as I was visibily pale (from infection), in considerable pain, and sleep deprived.  He is no longer my doctor.The surgeon prescribed oral and topical pain medicine and Ichthammol Ointment 20% strength, while allowing antibiotics to reduce my whole body infection.  I continued epson salt soakings follwed by pain medicine applications topped with Ichthammol ointment.  In less than 8 hours Ichthammol opened the boil, reducing my pain.  Ichthammol caused the boil to reopen repeatedly, evacuating fluids and aided reducing the infection while I painfully awaited surgery.  Boil Ease accomplished none of this.Ichthammol is a petroleum derivative, black vaseline type tool, expensive, feels and smells horrible.  I tell people it \"Could (proverbially) suck a golf ball through a garden hose\"...and recommend they try it on chiggers, bee stings, and all insect bites...to draw out toxins.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Did nothing for me", "unixReviewTime": 1343433600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2012"}

Why must they use this disclaimer, since it's like selling a headache pain pill that states that it is not at all effective for headache pain?Because, in 1994, the FDA passed a ruling that NO over-the-counter antifungal product is effective on the toe or finger nails, since they cannot possibly PENETRATE the nails themselves, therefore making the treatment completely INEFFECTIVE on the nail fungus itself (nail fungus grows on the nail bed skin, not the actual nail).So how can these anti nail fungus treatment medications legally be sold and marketed? Why, by highly \"creative\" wording in all of their print ads and labels, of course! These companies shrewdly use the fact that, technically, most of these products WILL treat your nail fungus to a certain degree, BUT ONLY IF YOU APPLY THE MEDICATION DIRECTLY TO THE NAIL BED; i.e., UNDER your finger or toe nails. These anti-fungal companies fail to make this very clear, for obvious reasons, so people assume you merely need to apply this to the OUTSIDE of the affected nail, which is a waste of YOUR time and money.

First I couldn't find it (must have been out of stock; later was there) then researched ingredients of the sugar-free and discovered it contains aspartame, which I feel is a poison (Google it). If I occasionally get a little I don't worry about it, but will not ingest it on a daily, deliberate basis.So I bought this regular Metamucil, started with a regular dose with plenty of fluid, experienced a pain like concrete at the duodenum, halved dosage and took daily with plenty of water. Every day I had worsening pain and cramps until one day it felt as though another dose would kill me. I have no way of knowing what reaction my body was having but I do suffer from more than my share of allergic reactions. Now you read what the ingredients are. FD&C; yellow #6? Google it. You may be startled. But that's not all. Do you really need the sucrose (sugar)? What about &#34;natural and artificial orange flavor&#34;? Note the exact composition of &#34;artificial orange flavor&#34; is not specified. How does the manufacturer get away with that?Then I asked friends whether they had any difficulty taking Metamucil. I got repeated stories of difficulties. Most simply refused doctors' orders and discontinued the stuff.Now obviously I was determined to find a way to take the prescribed psyllium. So I did research then talked to my MD. It turned out that I could buy pure powdered psyllium husk by the ounce at a local health food store, so didn't have to sink yet another ten-spot in an unusable product but could assess with a tiny amount. The product is from a trusted company. Then I did more research and purchased pure powdered psyllium SEED capsules online, actually via Subscribe & Save from Amazon. Before I did that, I called the manufacturer to be sure there were no additives. I was pleased with the response.Guess what? The pure psyllium is working. I prefer the capsules because when I mix the powder and take it that way, it's hard to get that last bit of psyllium out of the glass. Then, obviously, I wash the glass which means that every day some grains of psyllium go down the drain where as we know, they expand to 50 times their size. How long before I'll be calling the plumber because the drain is plugged? Think about it.Metamucil - the use of psyllium husk (or better yet, the seed) - to solve health problems - is a real step in the right direction. But for some (many?) of us, the additives are unnecessary and/or troublesome, to put it mildly. Thus I present my experience and my solution.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Trouble taking Metamucil?

Hmmmm... that was enough incentive for me to run as fast as I could to the local market to purchase that first canister of this excellent product.

As other reviewers put it, I concur that the poop process became effortless, smooth and very clean.

It has been on the market so long because it does it well. I take this product because my Doctor recommended it for good digestive and cardiac health. Some people (my Doctor included) feel that the benefits of a diet high in fiber, in this case psyllium, go beyond the GI tract and are beneficial to other physical systems. I have been taking this for several years (I take the capsules when I travel) with no side effects. Some people find the taste a bit objectionable, but I guess that I am just used to it by now.Psyllium is used in Metamucil because of its very high mucilage content. Mucilage is the term used to describe a group of gelling agents made from plant fibers. Mucilage is made by grinding or milling the outer layer of the seed. Mucilage made from \"Plantago\" seeds is called psyllium husk. The mucilage from psyllium husk is a hydrophilic (water-loving), white, fibrous material. When water is absorbed (in this case in the intestines), the mucilaginous gel that forms increases in volume by more than a factor of ten, which, of course, is why it is extremely effective as a bulk laxative, as it is not digested by the small intestine. Because of this, psyllium mucilage serves to absorb excess water, while simultaneously stimulating gastrointestinal elimination.As a socio-political aside, the United States is the world's largest psyllium importer, with the bulk (please pardon the pun) of imports for use in products such as Metamucil.Now that you know all about the wonders of psyllium, you should know this: this is a very large container of psyllium. Very large. So large it does not fit in some cabinets, depending on shelf height. If you want to keep your Metamucil habit discreet, be forewarned that this is an extremely large container of fiber, and can be unwieldy to conceal.Buying in bulk makes this a bargain!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fiber: A Brief History", "unixReviewTime": 1132704000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2005"}

I used to just add Benefiber to my coffee in the morning and it was tasteless, clear and did not get thick.  Very painless way to get fiber.

Oh, maybe some lubrication, but if you press even moderately hard, you'll understand the true meaning of \"razor burn\" because the head of my Braun gets almost too hot to touch without any lubricant.- Probably not quite as smooth a shave as Williams, but that's very subjective, and likely due to the fact that the razor doesn't glide over your face as easily as with an oil pre-shave.- Takes awhile to dry - maybe an extra 5 minutes, and you DO need to let it dry.As noted, not being oily is a plus AND a minus.  As a pre-shave, it works, and it depends on what you're used to; level of irritation is about the same with Williams and this product (I'd been using the Williams for sensitive skin, which is hard to come by now).

Much larger and thicker than the silver haired gentleman's pictured in the AD here.  Unlike many others, mine is not one that I sport for curling the ends up in a twist.  Its much too broad across my face for that anyway.  Although many men use wax to curl the ends into a point, I use it for basically keeping the 'stache neat and in place.  If you have a mustache that is big enough to cross your cheeks, even without a curly point it will tend to fall down and you will be constantly brushing it up with your fingers or with a comb.  Not only is the Clubman wax the best I have ever used, but it is also one of the very few true waxes that are even available these days.  (The alternative Colonel Conks brand sold here as well I received as a gift one Christmas and did not care for it). I spread a smidgen of the Clubman on in the morning and then  brush it into place and it tends to stay that way all day.  And if some commotion comes along to disturb it, a little touch up with a brush or comb and you are once again debonair.  Mustache wax is something that is not easy to imitate with something like Vaseline or hair spray.  Its got a strange quality to it that holds things in place well enough, but at the same time doesn't come off as too greasy or overly stiff.  You get used to the Clubman very quickly after the first few uses, and then you will find it a cinch to know the exact amount and procedure to use in order to keep your 'stache neat and presentable to your liking.  I highly recommended it as the oldest and still the best around.It can still be found in a few drug stores here and there if you look hard enough, but it is much easier to purchase here on Amazon.  I would suggest that you buy at least a couple of tubes at a time to make the shipping worth it.  And one last thing, I would bet that the great majority of Clubman users use the neutral base over a particular color.  It does the job while remaining invisible.  Something that the tinted wax available does not do. My experience with the colored waxes is that they were hard to spread evenly enough to look at all natural, and necessitated much more reapplying to keep the color even that the neutral never requires.

I bought a tube of Rite Aid mustache wax and it was clumpy and horrible. I will say however that the Rite Aid kit came with a much nicer little comb and a pair of scissors though.Clubman is creamy and goes on without clumping. I think something that needs to be said in these reviews of mustache wax is that you need to buy the right wax for your particular stache. If you are looking for some wax to harden the ends of a handbar, that's different than wax to stiffen up a part in a bushy stache. I think a creamy wax (type type) is better for general conditioning and parting. A harder wax (like the types found in metal tins) is better for stiffening.I'm in the process of growing a handlebar mustache so I need something that will work for both. I don't think Clubman holds as stiff as some people say. There are better waxes out there if you want a real stong hold.

In addition, the tiny spaces between your teeth will be much freer of plaque buildup.Some people have a type of saliva that actually helps plaque to gather and build up in the tiny spaces between your teeth. Because I cannot use dental floss well I use this instead to remove any tiny food particles that may be stuck between my teeth at the end of the day. It's relatively easy in my case: I just insert the rubber gum tip in between my teeth, rub the tip back and forth while pressing backward to go in as deep as possible between my teeth; and then remove the gum tip to rinse it off. That's that!Amazon notes that the rubber tip is latex free in case that matters to you.I highly recommend this for persons like myself who have trouble using dental floss and who want to keep their teeth and gums healthy.

After all, he explained, chronic dry mouth is not only uncomfortable but can interfere with daily activities, can result in, or be a symptom of, more serious health problems, and may be caused by hundreds of different medications and treatments. (He must have Googled the term.) So, armed with James' firsthand experience, as well as information from Biotene's manufacturers (see their incredibly informative website at [...]) we proceed:Biotene is a mouthwash designed especially for symptoms of \"dry mouth.\" (Again, see laclede.com, an impartial medical website, or your physician for more information). In any event, you may wish to consult with a physician because--as noted above--the condition may be a side effect of a medication (as it was in the case of my friend) or a symptom of an even more serious disorder. Biotene claims (on their bottle) that it \"cleans and refreshes and helps in the healing of minor irritation.\"Ingredients include three enzymes and one protein that occurs naturally in saliva (lysozyme, lactoferrin, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase), and xylitol for sweetening. Therefore it contains no sugar or saccharin, but you might want to consult on xylitol. Glucose Oxidase and Lactoperoxidase generate \"a constant flow of OSCN ions (hypothiocyanite), a strong antibacterial agent that should always be present in saliva.\"Lysozyme is an enzyme thats attacks bacteria, and lactoferrin binds with iron, thus inhibiting pathogenic bacteria.According to James, the taste is mild, not sugary or overly syrupy, and there is no stinging. A smaller size is available, but you'll pay much more per ounce. On the other hand, if you've never tried it before, and can't score a physician sample, you might want to try out the two ounce side first.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Alcohol and Sugar Free Mouthwash for \"Dry Mouth\" Consult your Doctor.", "unixReviewTime": 1230249600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2008"}

The lip barn is hard, I have used it for 1 week now and the edges of the stick are still hard and did not get rounded. With Chapstick after a couple of uses the end of the tube becomes nicely round and feels good on your lips.4. Packaging. The lip balm comes in a white tube which has a label glued to it.

It lasts for hours and has no real taste to it at all.  Unpleasant or otherwise.

I hate the way that chapstick and lotion feels so I usually just let it go.  But when my knuckles bleed, it's time to put some lotion on.  I tend to wait until it's too late to put moisturizer on.  Anyways, I bought 1 stick of this stuff for 3.00 on ebay and you can get 12 sticks for 15 dollars here on amazon.  I didn't need that many, plus I wanted to test it before buying that many.  This stuff is pretty good.  I was looking for a chapstick that gives you that cooling relief to let you know it's working and soothes the lips.  It gives a normal amount of cooling relief and I like it.  The smell is very similar to chewing tobacco mint flavored.  It's not too strong but you notice it when you first put it on.  It also has SPF 15 so in the summer at the beach this stuff will be great.  I read all the great reviews here on Amazon and needed something with that cooling relief so I tried it out and I'm glad I did.  I am still searching for Aveeno's Cooling Relief Lip Balm because that stuff is amazing and worked very well, but this is a good substitute and probably a lot cheaper.

I got a UTI while taking the D-Mannose, so I switched back to Cystex and have been loyal to them ever since.For women who suffer from UTIs like I do, I would recommend Cystex hands down.

The dosage instructions indicate 2 tsp. every 15 minutes until you feel better. To be fair, I gave my daughter one teaspoon. She then stopped vomiting. I gave her another dosage about 45 minutes later (I couldn't get her to take another dose sooner) but she was right as rain sleeping within a few minutes of the first dose/incident.A few days later, I am up, feeling rough, and hate vomiting. I took the requisite dosage, and started to immediately feel the feeling recede. A second dose, and I too, was ready to sleep. The grown up dose is two tablespoons every 15 minutes.This stuff is made from fructose and phosphoric acid. It coats the tummy and quiets the nerves that are all flipping out and causing the nausea, probably like that old coke syrup the pharmacy used to sell. For that reason, it doesn't have the same risks of Reyes Syndrome associated with old Pink.The taste is like a thick cherry syrup, similar to the taste of chewable Tylenol from back in the day. Not great, but not as unbearable as getting sick.

This winter seemed especially harsh.  My entire family ( extended included) got hit with this.  My son, then daughter, then my wife.  I knew I was on deck.  I will preface this by saying I'm one of the biggest babies when it comes to throwing up.  I hate it with a passion ( does anyone actually LIKE it?).  My wife teases me ( makes fun of me) b/c of the violent, exorcism like sounds of my hurl.  Sorry for the visual, just trying to set the stage here.  So I know im certainly gonna get sick.  I frantically search amazon for anything nausea related.  Now this may sound selfish, because I didn't order it til after my family was sick, but to be fair, it all happened so fast.  Luckily I had prime service .  I knew I had about a 2 day incubation period before the attack would happen.  A few days later, my little bottle of joy arrived,As I prepared for my inevitable illness, those next few days I did everything I could to avoid the bug.  I carried around Lysol in a holster and whipped it out all around the house.  I kept kisses to the wife and kids to forehead only.  I drank so much green juice, i almost liked the taste of it.....ALMOST.  It didn't matter.  It was too late.  I could do nothing to stop this awful, terrible virus.That night, I took an extra hot shower.  I used mouthwash, twice.  I knew I was only moments away.  I unpacked my bottle of Emitrol and got it ready, like a solider loading his ammo before battle.  I got into bed, and told my wife I loved her.  I knew what was coming.  A night full of chills, shivering, yet burning up.  Constant struggle , whining like a child back and forth in bed in between trips to the bathroom.  The horrific sounds of my excessively annoying throw up sound.  A horrible night sleep for not only me, but my wife, mother of my 2 small children, and for tonight only, a 3rd-the biggest baby of them all...I'm not sure what happened next.  I remember turning over and looking at the clock.  It was 10:43pm EST (22:43 in military time ..I think ).  The wave of nausea that hit me was fierce.  I knew what i had to do.  I went straight to the bathroom and began to vomit.  I will spare u the details but it was brutal.  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  There would be no downtime, no breaks between the pain.  I was on the floor shivering, begging God for mercy, promising I would go to church more.  I am not strong enough to handle this!!!  And I stopped for a moment to think.  \"Wait, is that my wife laughing?\"  Anyway, no time for self pity.  I had to think and I had to think fast.  I looked over and desperate for an answer, there appeared something strange, out of the corner of my eye.  The Emitrol.  My oasis.  I quickly ran over, took a huge swig.  I was convinced that it wouldn't work.  That it was just too weak to contain this awful nausea I felt.  The worst anyone has probably ever felt ( this is said with obvious embarrassment during my time of need).  Literally within minutes, I felt a calm come across me.  A stillness among the ocean of madness.  It had worked.  It really worked!  I felt I must go back to bed quickly.  While I still feel ok.  I fell asleep.....I woke up at 6:43 the next day.  I had only thrown up once.  I did not feel nauseous, just tired and wiped out.  Emetrol had saved me.  It really saved me.  I recommend having a bottle around in the house.  It's safe for children as well.  Next time I will not hesitate to give it to anyone in the family.  Something that finally works to battle nausea!!

I recently encountered exactly this situation due to a rather debilitating and thoroughly unpleasant fast-moving virus making the rounds. Not really being a drinker, I don't have a lot of experience with regurgitation and was certainly caught off guard by the sudden onset and viciousness of the attack on my digestive tract. Pandemonium reigned: I couldn't even keep water down, and the mere thought of food was a terrible idea for reasons I'd rather not get into here.Anyway... My doctor told me to stay hydrated (not as easy as it seemed) and that it would quickly pass. (Was that a pun at my expense? I still don't know, but didn't have the predisposition to go into the finer points of digestive humor right then.) I asked a pharmacist what she recommended, and she said the best over the counter medicine for nausea and vomiting was Emetrol. She instructed to take the medicine by drinking the syrup and then not drinking anything else immediately afterwards, repeating per the directions on the box. While Emetrol didn't entirely eliminate my nausea, it did dramatically cut down on the episodes of projectile vomiting I had been dealing with. It does have a very sweet cherry flavor that's not particularly palatable, but tastes better than bile coming the other way.Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any medicine, of course, and be advised that this contains fructose, so if you have fructose intolerance obviously don't use this. Diabetics also know that it's made from a sugar base, so definitely don't use it without talking to your doctor first.Emetrol worked well for me. I know this review is lighthearted, but rest assured I am quite serious that the product worked as advertised for me, and if you need quick relief from severe nausea, it's a good place to start.

Id give her a dose of this as recommended on the label & the first time or two it seemed to come back up but that 3rd go round or 2nd go round always seemed to do the trick. Once this stuff calms the stomach, try encouraging the child to sip on some chamomile herbal tea.

The first one was horrible, as long as I was giving him doses of the Emetrol he was okay, but when he went to sleep he woke up vomiting. I made him drink some chamomile tea with lemon and honey (naturally he became thirsty)..and that seemed to put an end to that viscious monster of a stomach virus. Amazingly, i didnt catch it from him that time. But this he came into the bathroom one morning and started throwing up. I couldnt believe it twice in thevwinter season he caught this virus. It was not nearly as bad as his first time. I gave him a dose of Emetrol, even a teaspoon of lemon juice to kill of some of this bacteria causing this virus. That came back up. He vomited twice, and I then gave him some Chamomile tea, Ginger tea combo sweetented with honey. He had one episode of diarrhea also this time. He was just fine shortly after that.But this time I caught it from him. For years as a witness seeing my kids go through it. And hearing other people describe how awful of an experience it actually was. I got to experience this nightmare first hand for the first time in my 36 years of life. Diarrhea and vomiting. I had already felt bad sore throat headache but felt my immune system was strong enough as it always had been. NOT THIS TIME! Omg, i was on my phone minding my business when suddenly i was hit with this amazing stomach cramp. The pain felt like it crawled from the front to back & back around front.

Way better than the Mach 2, which in turn was revolutionary compared to safety blades. However, that was many years ago. Comparing it with a 3-blade Schick, the Mach 3 is inferior.I had been using Gillette products for decades, but decided to run a test. I am Caucasian, my beard is of medium thickness, and I shave daily in the shower. I opened a Gillete and a Schick, and alternated until the Gillette became unuseable. Both gave me equally good shaves, but throughout the Schick never scratched, and adjusted better to areas that are not flat (around the chin, and around the lips). This is not surprising if you look at the blade mounts: hold the ends and notice how the Schick can flex in the middle, allowing it to follow curvy areas easily, which the Gillette has a center support that prevents that. Besides being better at not nicking/scratching, the Schick blades lasted about twice as long.Since I had bought quite a few cartridges, and the Mach 3 are inferior but still useable, I used the rest. This re-confirmed my past perceptions (from years of use), as well as the test result.BTW, other reviewers who complained about scratching, or short blade life, thought they might have received counterfeit Gillette cartridges (they were on some refill program and the packaging was different). Not my case: I got regular Gillette packages, so my review applies to the real thing.Since I switched to Schick razors, I decided to also test the shaving gels. I tried about half a dozen, and found out that the Nivea gel works noticeably better than any other brand (smoother shave, dries less the skin, and has a pleasant and mild scent).Goodbye, Gillette!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Mach 3 inferior to Schick blades", "unixReviewTime": 1368144000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2013"}

It was much smoother than any other razor I'd ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I've noticed, however, that it doesn't take that long before the shave isn't quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it's just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I've never had any problems with the handle, and I've been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.There may be better razors or blades out there, but I'm content enough with the Mach 3 that I've stocked up on enough to last me for years!If these are inferior knockoffs, I guess I just haven't noticed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great, Smooth Shave but a Little Pricey", "unixReviewTime": 1302912000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2011"}

These cartridges have been a great replacement, but I think there's something important you should consider when buying them.  There are negative reviews here where customers say they got fake or knock-off replacements.  I added this to cart by picking a Prime eligible product that says &#34;Shipped from and sold by Amazon&#34;, and the package that arrived is the real deal.If you're new to the Mach 3, it's a great razor for a lot of things.  I have a friend who swears by it for shaving his head, but says you have to be slow and careful.  For me, it does a great job on my face and neck.  The three hyper-sharp blades in the Mach 3's head really do a nice job of paring down the daily stubble without cutting me up or roughing up my face.  That said, there are some basics to shaving that also make a difference, regardless of what you use:- drag slowly- drag in the direction the hair grows (and learn the parts of your face where it changes direction)- don't press down- do repeat strokes for problem areas- expect to feel some stubble no matter what--the goal is to minimize it, but it'll never go away unless you pluck the hairs out (ouch!)- when you towel off, pat your skin, don't scrub- if you're going to put something on your skin afterwards, avoid anything with alcohol in it: alcohol burns your skin while lotions moisturizeI use these in a standard Mach 3 handle and in one that vibrates using a AAA battery.  The latter is a bit easier to use, but not necessary:  either will work for you just fine.  There is a more expensive version of these blades for sensitive skin that is supposed to have better lubricating strips, but I don't find that to be worth the extra money...if anything the strips on the 'Sensitive' just wear out quicker than these do.If you're new to the Mach 3, it's a great razor.

There's no special technique, it's easy to clean, and it's disinclined to cut you. It doesn't feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I'm using the same handle, and I've since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can't feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don't reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won't fare as well. I've bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.I've generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it's difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it's been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge.

The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998, and while I don't remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set (or \"system,\" i.e., a handle and two blades), it was probably in 1998 or 1999. Since then I've gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven't had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I've read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I'm not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I'd go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it's never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don't have sensitive skin, I've found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I've used.)Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I've had, and that makes sense, because every guy's beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day's growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I keep coming back to the Mach3", "unixReviewTime": 1330560000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2012"}

There is still a scar but it has lost most of the ugly, snarled appearance it started off with. The marks from the thread used to sew his arm are nearly gone. The scar itself is a pale pink color. You can definitely still see the injury but I am totally sold on this product. Because of how well it has worked so far for him, I intend to purchase some of the stretch mark cream once my baby is born in February. I will also post updates as his arm continues to heal.

I looked into ways to get rid of the scar and gave Mederma a try.  I start to apply the gel as soon as possible once the healing has happened and have had tremendous success.  I have a pale skin-tone and had a REALLY unsightly scar on the top of my hand that I could not hide at all.  It was so embarrassing and I felt quite self-conscience about it.  I applied Mederma religiously, night and day, over the course of 6 months and it went away.  Oh, I can't even tell you how thankful I am that it did.  The discoloration is still slightly there, but it's REALLY hard to see.  It would probably go away even further if continued to apply it, but nobody even notices it anymore and I have completely forgotten about it.I had a second cut on my index finger that started to look horrible, and again, applied Mederma and like magic, completely gone.  I just ordered a new tube of the gel to treat a spot on my shoulder where I had a biopsy taken, and I already know that it'll look fine when it's all done.  You will still be able to tell that a biopsy was taken, but the incredibly ugly red blotch will be gone.The key to using Mederma is that you have to use it multiple times a day for months, and even longer if it's an old scar.  New scars heal faster, which is why I don't even mess around and go straight to using it ASAP.  A tube of this stuff lasts a long time, and I go through about 3/4 of a tube per scar.  It doesn't take much, just a tiny little drop.  It's clear, rubs in really easy, and there's no medicine smell.Incidentally, I asked my doctor what would be good for removing a scar, and he said that any lotion that had Vitamin E would do the trick.  I asked him about these scar gels and he said that all they are is a gel with Vitamin E in them.  So, I'm sure that no matter which scar gel you choose, Mederma or not, it'll probably work fine.Once my scar heals, I will post a before and after pic.Ingredients are: Water (purified), PEG-4, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allium CEPA (Onion) Bult Extract, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Methylparaben, Sorbic Acid, FragranceIf you have any questions about the gel, just ask in the comments and I'll try and respond promptly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yes, it really works!", "unixReviewTime": 1371772800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2013"}

Godwin \"WWRD\"", "helpful": [16, 16], "reviewText": "-Powerful odor protection that lasts all day-Clean masculine scentI have sensitive skin and have experimented with many different deodorants to find those that offer good odor protection without inflaming my skin. In my search, there are 3 types that I can use regularly without a problem and out of those, Speed Stick Musk is my #1 CHOICE!! To me it smells great. If you've never smelled this, I think it closely resembles the scent of some kind of canned shaving foam. If you've never thought about trying this because you've smelled musk after-shave....don't worry, it's NOT LIKE THAT STUFF. The scent is VERY clean without being overly strong like some others. Recently, it seems that some deodorants try to concentrate more on smelling like cologne than being a product to rub on your pits.Speed Stick Musk is a clear solid so there is none of that white gunk that can grab onto your hairs and discolor your shirts. For me, I have observed that the odor protection is BETTER than any other I have tried which proves to me that expensive doesn't mean better. This has EVERTHING I'm looking for...First and most importantly, it's EFFECTIVE and GENTLE on my skin.Secondly, it has a fresh, clean scent.Lastly, it's a GREAT value.This contains only six ingredients with stearyl alcohol being listed last and is thankfully ALUMINUM FREE!. Maybe that's why I have found it to be refreshingly gentle yet completely powerful. Whatever it is....I LOVE IT. For a guy that has never been completely brand-loyal, this is one of those brands where I make an exception.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful Protection, Clean Scent & ALUMINUM-FREE", "unixReviewTime": 1278288000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2010"}

I wafted the fumes from above the opening of the dispenser, but alas, it was not enough for my olfactory to detect.  I continued by gently placing my nostrils over the calm, green, glowing stick, and inhaled slightly.  Clean.  Crisp.  Ok, it's worth a try.  As I lifted my arm, I felt a slight quiver from the hairs waiting earnestly.  Would this prove to be another painful ordeal, rife with pain and hours of torment?  Sure, it might cover the smell, but at what cost?  Cautiously, carefully, I pressed the cool greenness into my hairy cavern of arm-torso, and waited.  No stinging.  No redness.  No irritation.

Also, insofar as use on his sensitive skin, the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However, what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left, which he will grudgingly use, unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.

Serotonin gives the mind a peaceful satisfied feeling.  The human body secretes melatonin from the pineal gland.  The release of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and promotes sleep when the hormone levels are sufficient.  1 to 3 mg (1-3 drops) of Melatonin will work to promote a sleepy feeling and aids in sleep.  This product instructs one to take 4 mg of Melatonin, which is the highest dose of Melatonin recommended by most sleeping aid products.I have found that the occasional use of Melatonin has helped me to fall asleep easier.  I don't believe this product should be used on a nightly basis, as regular daily use actually inhibits the natural production of Melatonin in one's body.I have had no hang-over effect in using Melatonin.  Some sleep aids have Diphenhydramine as the active ingredient and these give a noticable hang-over effect the following morning.  For those with intractable insomnia, I suppose a Diphenhydramine product and a Melatonin product could be combined to give a turbo-charged sleeping pill.

He just can't seem to turn his brain off and was always up too long at night.  His bedtime has been consistent at 8 during the school year and between 8:30 & 9 during the summer, but he would still be up in his room until after 10 sometimes.  Lights out and everything.  Just staring at the ceiling.  Or he'd make several bathroom trips just to have something to do.  There were many nights when he'd come up and say he just couldn't get to sleep.  I don't give my kids caffeine or too much sugar and they get plenty of exercise.  Well he was diagnosed this year w/ Asperger's Syndrome so that explains a lot of things but his pediatrician recommended melatonin to help him fall asleep.  I tried the pills but he just can't get them down so I figured I'd try this.As with most anything you buy, it's got its pros & cons.Pros:-This has helped so much in helping him fall asleep more quickly.  He's not been coming up at all to say he can't sleep.  When I ask him how he slept he tells me \"really well.\"-Since he's sleeping better at night he's been up with the rest of us in the morning without being a crab because he's tired.Cons:-This stuff doesn't taste like raspberry or vanilla.  I've tasted it myself and it was like something you should put in a shot glass.  We've kinda worked around that (my son has issues with strong tastes and was spitting it out the first time.)  I will have the melatonin ready for him while he gets a glass of water.

Originally, I was instructed to take it by a nutritionist.  However, I have gone into a store that carried many brands of vitamins, and when I compared the components, I still preferred Twinlab.  Twinlab makes a variety of multivitamins, including with and without iron, and a one-a-day and a two-a-day variety.  I have chosen the one-a-day version because it does not load me up with the B vitamins excessively.  I have had negative experiences with high levels of B vitamins.  The most annoying is insomnia when I take too much vitamin B6, but I have also experienced the \"niacin flush\", where you get a hot flash after ingesting a high dose of niacin.  I do need extra B12, so I take it in another supplement.  If you need a hypoallergenic vitamin made with high standards for the ingredients, with a good spectrum of minerals, then this is the one for you.Be advised, however, that no multivitamin will provide you with sufficient doses of calcium and magnesium.  These are minerals that your body needs, that you usually do not get in sufficient quantities in an American diet.  The reason is that these minerals are bulky, and will not fit in a multivite tablet or capsule.  Calcium for a woman entering menopause consists of two big tablets per day.  The same with magnesium, which you need for your bones.  So take your multivite, but look into taking supplementary calcium and magnesium, as well.  Your needs will vary with age and gender.After reading several other people's comments, I see that upset stomach is a common side effect of this supplement.  I have always taken them right at the same time as my meals, and I have had no trouble along those lines.  If you read the bottle, you will find that there is as much as 1667% of your daily needs for the B vitamins.  Actually, this is kind of low for the health food brands of vitamins.  As I mentioned above, B vitamins do have side effects, so if you want to try this multivite, maybe you should start out with a small bottle to see if it agrees with you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Favorite Multivite", "unixReviewTime": 1358121600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2013"}

Anyone who expects fast weight loss, has not read the articles on CLA. I bought this product mainly for two reasons: (1) I read \"The Cure for Heart Disease\" (a great book, by the way) and the cardiologist who wrote it recommended CLA because it can reduce inflammation in the body, lead to a better proportion of lean body mass to fat in the body, lead to a better balance of blood fats which can affect heart and blood vessel health, and lead to - very slow however - weight loss. I do not need to lose weight but I do want to lose body fat, as I am \"skinny fat\" and while I exercise daily to work towards this goal, I can use a little help from this CLA product. Also with heart disease history in my family, this supplement makes sense for that reason. I have tried another brand of CLA however that other brand, really upset my stomach, even though it was 1000mg and therefore less than this product. The Natrol CLA at 1200 mg does not bother my stomach at all and I am very happy with it. I am here at amazon to buy my 2nd bottle. The price is also terrific.

However, after a week of taking this I noticed increased fat gain mostly in my stomach where I never gain weight which has been quite hard to lose. I've also noticed that the side effects of increased temperature went away after s few days. I heard that cla only works if lifting weights or exerciseing heavily otherwise the acid turns into fat. I stopped taking it and am working on ridding of the excess stomach fat it gave me. Im currently trying cayenne pepper to speed up my metabolism which so far seems to be working.Note**I did NOT buy CLA Tonalin on amazon, I bought it in the grocery store (Hannaford) for about ten dollars but before I even got to the cashier, I was on my smart phone looking up the product on amazon to see how its rated. I trust the reviews on here so I decided I'd make my own.Also**I am not overweight but I have gained ten pounds since the semester started at college. I could blame it on the beer or pizza but the only reasons I was indulging in those things was because I had gone through a very stressful event right before fall semester started and stress apparently makes me overeat all the wrong foods. I usually am extremely healthy and eat a gluten free, paleo diet.My weight was relatively stable in November (and no still not overweight, just a much curvier version of myself). Then of course another extremely event had to occur right before final exams, by that point I given up the unhealthy lifestyle but still found myself over eating purely out of stress. I also never slept, I wouldn't fall asleep until past midnight, would have to get up at 5:30 am for school and then nap during the day. I was always tired and had headaches and stressed and anxious, and my sleep schedule and stress could add on weight, but eating too much on top of that made me gain weight like crazy. After gaining 4 pounds in a week I freaked out, I had to do something different, I couldn't stand all of the excess fat, I could barely squeeze into my jeans! I still wasn't overweight but I definitely wasn't considered tiny like I used to be! So I started working out more (not really but going from like one day to two days working out) and tried very hard to eat less and de-stress during the day. I picked the CLA up while trying healthier habits and have noticed a big difference in fat loss. I gain weight mostly in my hip area and used to never have fat around my stomach so its very easy for me to tell if I'm gaining or losing weight just by looking at my stomach and how much I can grab. (Ten pounds ago I couldn't grab anything). Well when I was at my heaviest I could grab quite a bit, around my bellybutton and my sides. This has decreased by about half. Also, my hips have a little less fat. And I had just picked up the CLA three days ago! Now you could say, well this could be due to the increased exercise or eating less before taking the CLA and I agree, it could be. So I'm only giving it 4 stars for now and I'm going to come back and rate again. (Though, my sleep schedule has NOT changed).However, there are things I have noticed immediately from these pills besides fat loss:-Increased temperature. I'm ALWAYS cold plus I live in the second most northern state in the U.S. and its in the teens here. I've gotten to the point where three hours or so after I've taken a pill I have to go outside to cool down when my roommates are huddled in their electric blankets.-I'm starving. Again, this is the same time frame as when I notice a dramatic increase in temperature (about 3 hours after taking the pill). I feel like a teenage boy, I can't stop eating, and its not sugary fatty foods I crave like when I'm stressed, its high carb foods, the quickest thing to fill me up, flavor not mattering. I've been eating WAY more than usual from taking these pills. I used to only be able to eat toast in the morning, never for dinner or I'd gain weight ( I love toast lol) but now I can eat 2 slices at night (40 carbs) plus potatoes and squash and soup and chicken and a whole bag of light buttered popcorn and hot cocoa and lemonade and a granola bar and coconut ice cream and not gain weight, which is pretty amazing, since before, I would only the vegetables and chicken and maybe 1/3 a bag of popcorn and hot cocoa and not gain weight.My schedule with CLA:*Breakfast: (6 am):  I eat 3-4 slices of gluten free toast, greek yogurt, two cups of coffee. I do NOT take CLA, I figure my metabolism is highest in the morning and its not going to do much.*Lunch #1: (11 am): I have a spinach and fruit smoothie made with rice milk instead of fruit juice and only a little bit of yogurt. I do NOT take the CLA since the smoothie is really healthy compared to the rest of my meals.*Lunch #2: (1 pm): Full serving of Stir-fry with brown rice, light soy sauce, shrimp, and vegetables. I DO take a CLA at this point.*Dinner #1: (4 pm): Chicken, vegetables with light butter. I do NOT take a CLA.*Dinner #2: (7 pm): Chicken, vegetables with light butter, orange, hot cocoa, usually 20 min later..this is when cravings kick in. I DO take a CLA.*Dessert/Snack: (8:30-9 pm): Organic Popcorn, another hot cocoa, oranges, sometimes a granola bar or coconut ice cream. I DO take a CLA.So Overall, I eat like a hobbit. (throughout the day). So I can't base it off the whole three meals a day thing but I do only take it 3 times a day. I take it with meals, usually later in the afternoon/night when my metabolism is lower. I also take it right after I finished my plate with ALOT of water.When I used to eat this much, I was gaining weight if I didn't work out. Now I eat this much and I've barely increased my exercise regime, which is not intense, more weight training/resistance than anything, not much cardio at all.I'm going to give it another week before I reply again.But what you should take out of this review so far is that I'm young, healthy, not overweight, don't eat really unhealthy foods, but I'm used to being in a certain 5 lb range than I'm out of. My increased weight was due to stress. The CLA seems to dramatically increase my temperature (could be a direct correlation to metabolism?) as well as my hunger levels but decreases my cravings. I still have cravings but there very mild, I used to want to devour chocolate bars and cupcakes all the time ( I didn't but I wanted to) whereas now, a hot cocoa suffices to curb my cravings.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "works at. first then adds fat may work if lifting", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"}

No strange aftertaste, and real hints of honey (the peanut is a little harder to discern).  The texture is soft but with some heft, and, on entry one senses honey, sugar, a hint of peanut and oil, and a vague spicy background. IT's excellent, and not as sweet as the similar but too-sugary (for my taste) yoghurt honey peanut flavor.My only complaints (and this comes from the head, not the taste, Bud) are the plethora of vitamin and mineral additives (just a personal preference there), and the 3.5 grams of saturated fat, and 17 grams of sugar. However, this is within the range, I believe, of most of these products.On the positive side, you get 14 grams of sugar, and high percentage of the recommended daily values of a range of vitamins and minerals. Have one of these with a 2-3 lasses of water and you will feel full.  Also great as a post work-out pick-me-up.

The names don't even make sense -- they're both synthetic, one is just a closer structural mimic of whats found in food. It is still synthesized, specifically by methylation of gamma and beta tocopherol vitamers (plant oil extract).At the *very least* please try and stay under 400 IU/day.

And the gel inside is sufficient in amount to use for these other purposes, and while it is a gel, it's not super sticky. It spreads easily and absorbs into the skin well, which makes me think it probably absorbs well when ingested too.I will be buying these regularly from Twinlab, and I've been so impress, I'm buying other things of theirs as well, such as their NAC for liver toxicity issues and for people who take Tylenol regularly or drink frequently.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality Packaging, Quality Softgels", "unixReviewTime": 1396224000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2014"}

They are easy to use and it is, for the most part, easy to tell if I am in ketosis or not. If you're not, it's a pretty obvious negative. If you are, the strip turns pink (for &#34;trace&#34; amount of ketones, which is the most you'll ever get on a low-carb diet).I test my pee in the morning, and it's fun to start the day off with an indication that I did well on my diet the day before!I think that these strips won't be effective forever, because in &#34;The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living,&#34; the authors mention that after a few weeks of ketosis, the body begins to adapt.&#34;Within a few days of starting on carbohydrate restriction, most people begin excreting ketones in their urine.&#34;...But over a matter of weeks, the muscles stop using these ketones for fuel. Instead, muscle cells take up acetoacetate, reduce it to betahydroxybutyrate, and return it back into the circulation. Thus after a few weeks, the predominant form in the circulation is beta-hydroxybutyrate, which also happens to be the ketone preferred by brain cells (as an aside, the strips that test for ketones in the urine detect the presence of acetoacetate, not beta-hydroxybutyrate).&#34;In the kidney, this process of keto-adaptation is also complex. Over time, urine ketone excretion drops off, perhaps to conserve a valuable energy substrate (although urine ketone excretion never amounts to very many wasted calories). This decline in urine ketones happens over the same time-course that renal uric acid clearance returns to normal (discussed below) and thus may represent an adaptation in kidney organic acid metabolism in response to sustained carbohydrate restriction. These temporal changes in how the kidneys handle ketones make urine ketone testing a rather uncertain if not undependable way of monitoring dietary response/adherence. Testing serum for beta-hydroxybutyrate is much more accurate but requires drawing blood, and it is expensive because it is not a routine test that doctors normally order.&#34;(Phinney, Stephen; Volek, Jeff (2011-07-08). The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living: An Expert Guide to Making the Life-Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable (pp. 164-165). Beyond Obesity LLC. Kindle Edition.)So actually, if after a few weeks the strips say you're not in ketosis, it just may be a sign that your body has adapted to the low-carbohydrate diet, which is what you want.I've only been using them for about a week, so we'll see what happens in a few weeks.

I keep trying different sizes among the heavy or ultraabsorbancy, but haven't found one that I like nearly as much.These pads are okay.  Just okay.They are of course, long, like the package states. That works out great, because face it - leaks like to run backwards many times,and you can have a dry pad and a wet spot on the back part of your underwear because the leak went right past the pad. So, it catches most of those.I've had MULTIPLE times that these have leaked on the SIDES of the pads, requiring a change of clothing.They also like to &#34;wad up&#34;, not fully sticking properly to the underwear, especially if you sit in an office type chair a lot, as I do.The covering on the pad is not nearly as nice as the former ultra thin pads.  They can be irritating to the skin down there, and has also caused some breakouts. While I wouldn't think a pad would be an irritant, these often are.But my biggest complaint about these pads is that they are HOT!!  They are thick, there is ZERO air circulation of any kind down there while wearing them.  I've had my upper thighs break out from the pads rubbing on them, been sweaty not because the room is hot, but because it is creating a heat source down below from the thick padding!  Right now, it is winter time so it is not as bad as it could be. I could never wear these in summer!These might work well for some folks, but not so great for me. I have to &#34;rearrange&#34; them all the time, like every time I pull up my pants. The pad never wants to just stay put without a hassle. No, it doesn't move around on your undies - it just causes the undies to be crooked when you pull them up, because they are so thick they don't ever lay right.If you are very thin (which I am not), don't mind sitting on a thick pad, and would appreciate the extra body heat from them, then by all means, try them out.  For me, I am back to searching for a decent, thin, absorbant pad. I like the Tena brands, but all their changes in 2013 were NOT for the good, and have made most of their products undesirable to me.

I did decide to also do basal temperature to compare and find I'm more confident with this monitor. I am a light sleeper and my husband wakes 2 hours before me. I found that my temperatures can vary greatly.Downside: You have to pee on a stick for 10 days at a time. I can understand the first few times as it \"learning\" your cycle but don't understand why I have to continue once I've ovulated in a cycle.

I think next month I will just time it so I only have to use half a box per cycle (15 sticks).  Just start testing a few days later than the machine tells me to and stop testing after peak day will certainly cut down on stick usage and cost.Cons -- After you have spent morning after morning looking at the lines on the stick and seeing which one(s) show, it is easy to predict what the machine is going to say.  I sort of feel ripped off by having to use the machine to tell me what  I can plainly see with my own eyes.  But the machine makes it easy to keep track of cycle days and it is an easy reminder to test, so I am not overly upset.I also find it easier and more accurate to use the \"dip in a cup\" method over the \"running stream\" method.  Just use a disposable Dixie cup - much less messy and splashy.I am not sorry I bought the system -- I just need to tweak it a bit so that the sticks actually last me for three months.  Gave it four stars because it DOES what it is supposed to do, took away one star because it gets expensive to use as directed if you have any issues at all with your cycle.My suggestion is to not rely too heavily on this machine and take the time to learn your body signs since sometimes signs come later in the day, even when you have had a low fertility reading in the morning.

After all I'd heard about pregnancy taking a long time especially with older mothers, I was anxious to get a head start after getting married recently.  I had been on birth control pills since my 20s and came off them after our wedding a few months ago. At that time, my husband and I decided to wait a few months before trying to conceive, to clear any medications, vaccinations, and \"cosmeceuticals\"(Rx retin-A face cream, Latisse, etc) out of my system. But at that time I started taking prenatal multi, DHA, and calcium.  Then last month we decided to start trying to conceive, with the help of this CBE fertility monitor.This monitor is easy to use.  Just insert 4 AAA batteries (not incl). Turn it on. Press the \"m\" button until you get to the current day of your cycle (you can set it on any of days 1-5). Whatever time of day you set the \"m\" button, that will be the middle of your 6 hour test window. So each day, you can turn on the monitor and test any time during the 3 hours before and the 3 hours after that time. I set mine at 7am so I could test from 4-10am.  If you plan to travel across alot of time zones so that your test window is no longer in the morning, you can still use it within that same window (so in my case, that would be whatever local time is at 4-10am in my home time zone).  Just hold your urine for at least 4 hours before testing, to simulate it being your first morning urine (hormones have more time to build up that way).Then every morning, turn on the monitor before you use the bathroom. For a few days it won't tell you to do anything, and it just tells you what day it is (1, 2, 3, etc) and shows a \"low\" reading, so then you turn it off. On the days when you turn it on and it shows a flashing test stick symbol, you take a test each such day, using your first morning urine. You can hold the test stick in your urine stream or dip it into a cup of urine.  You can collect urine in a cup if you cannot test right away, you can store the urine and test later. Then insert the test stick into the monitor in the direction shown in the instructions, until it clicks. Wait a few minutes and come back and check it.  If you wait too long and the monitor turns off (I would forget about it while eating breakfast), no problem, just turn it back on and the test result will be waiting for you.  It will take about 20 test days in the first cycle to learn your cycle.  After that it should ask you for about 10 or so tests per cycle. It is supposed to give you a few days of \"high\", 2 days of \"peak\" and 1 day of \"high\" readings, in that exact order (H,H,H,P,P,H). Ovulation itself should be on the last peak day or on the last high day.  The monitor may not give peak days in some cycles but it doesn't mean ovulation didn't occur. So in any case you should BD on some of the high days, not just peak.You must buy the packages of 30 test sticks separately, so if you order this monitor, you also need to buy a package of 30 test sticks and also separately get 4 AAA batteries. Store the monitor and test sticks on your dresser in the bedroom, or anyplace outside the bathroom since the humidity of the bathroom can damage it.  It's about the size of a bigger point-n-shoot digital camera or a handheld GPS. I kept it on a small tray (better for my sleepy self to not drop it) and carried it and a test stick into the bathroom each morning when I woke up.I used this monitor with my cycle that first month, starting on the first full day of my cycle as day 1 for the monitor.  It had me testing about 20 times that cycle.  The reading was \"low\" up through day 12 of my cycle.  Day 13-15 were all \"high\" readings, and day 16-17 were both \"peak\" with the egg symbol, and day 18 was \"high\".  After that it went back to \"low\" the remaining days.  This is consistent with the intended results.  DH and I \"Baby Danced\" on days 13, 16 and 17. On the morning of day 18, I had ovulation spotting so I know the fertility monitor was accurate. Here I am now, as shocked as anyone to be a few weeks into my first pregnancy on our first try, as my new husband and I are approaching 40. We are both basically healthy, reasonably active, non-smokers who eat a mix of junk food and healthy food.  So it was not cheap, but to me worth the cost to have more certainty of when to time things, especially since I'm not the kind of person who will do the basal temperature method, and my schedule and business trips to distant countries (and jet lag in each direction) make my cycles too erratic sometimes to predict with much precision with a calendar method. And the cervical mucus method seems too subjective for my preference.In conjunction with using this monitor, I also read the first few chapters of the \"Making Babies\" 3 month program for maximum fertility.  There were some really useful tips in the beginning few chapters that could apply to anyone seeking to become pregnant, and the timing of the whole conception process and when to BD corresponds directly to the CBE fertility monitor.  The rest of that book could be interesting if you were struggling with fertility issues.  I took some of the suggestions about nutrition, lifestyle, etc though and this probably helped too.BTW, in case you're wondering if you can buy a used CBE monitor, the instructions say not to do so because the monitor learns your cycle and becomes tailored to you.  However, the instructions also say that if you let the batteries die or take them out, the monitor will lose all stored info and will have to learn your cycle from scratch again. Take that as you will.Good luck to all!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked first cycle, late 30s and pregnant for the first time", "unixReviewTime": 1328918400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2012"}

After 5 months of using the monitor and 12 months of TTC total I started to get worried so I saw a reproductive endocrinologist--I am only 33 years old.For the past 2 months, the monitor has told me my fertility was still high just a few days before my expected period--and one month it told me I had not ovulated at all nor did I have any \"high\" fertility days. Yet, that same month my RE did an ultrasound and said that yes, I indeed ovulated!! I missed out on prime fertility time!! I am so disappointed. I had been scheduling around this monitor and to know it is this inaccurate makes me angry. And it is not cheap either--neither are the sticks. So sadly, I am done with this. I thought I was some kind of freak since it was not working for me. Even my RE said to \"Throw it out, it's only stressing you out anyway\".

Also, there were a few cycles where I had to use 20 sticks (I had moved, my cycles were irregular), but now I only use about 5 sticks per cycle.  If you are monitoring your cervical mucus and it's getting slippery, that is when your estrogen is going up.  Testing before can be waste of sticks.  I also do not test after I hit my LH surge (the first peak day), as that is a waste of sticks too.  So, this system does work, you do get better with practice, if you can get it down to 5 (or even 6 sticks), it gets alot more economical too.

I found out I ovulate later in the day (around 11am - 2pm) which the Wondfo sticks confirmed.

We didn't want to waste any time trying to have a baby so I bought this monitor.  We started using it in September and last week (end of November), I found out I'm pregnant!  So it took us 3 cycles.  The first month I had about 10 high days and finally got a peak on day 19 and 20.  My cycle is only 30 days long so that made me nervous!  It just seemed late.  But the second month, I had 2 high days and then it peaked on day 16 and 17.  The third month, it went straight from low to peak.  It peaked on day 17 and 18.  I thought it was odd that I didn't get any high days but that was the month I got pregnant.  We had sx day 17, 18 and 19.  We did not do it in the few days leading up to that peak because it was still on low.Being really type A, the third month I also had purchased cheap ovulation test strips from CVS - the store brand.  And they coincided with the monitor perfectly.  The only odd thing is that the test strips remained positive for four days.  Whereas the monitor goes on autopilot after it hits your peak.  So you only get two peak days no matter what with the monitor.  I'm not sure why the test strips gave me four days of positives but I just thought it was interesting.  I am happy to know that the monitor and the test strips peaked at the same time.A few recommendations --- if you have time -i.e. you are young and are just starting to try, you really don't need to buy this monitor right away.  For all I know, I might have gotten pregnant anyway without it.  And given the store brand ovulation test strips peaked at the same time, you could just try those for a few months.  I should also add that I used pre-seed all three months and sat with my legs propped up for a half hour after every time we tried.  (Yes, I looked ridiculous...haha but I figured I should do everything I can to make it happen)I know that's a lot of information!  But I really enjoyed reading the reviews on here so I figured someone might want to hear my story.  Assuming everything goes well with this pregnancy, we plan to use the monitor for baby # 2 as well.Update: I'm now 18 weeks pregnant and since originally writing this review, the doctor confirmed (based on the size of the baby/etc.) that I did conceive at the time the monitor peaked.

I've noticed all the negative reviews have been by women only, although many women here too praise the product.  I say I'm a guy and, like a lot of guys, armpit smell, especially after 24 hours, is quite common for me, even if I have a non-strenuous day, so I was looking for a long-lasting, natural, non-aluminum deodorant that I could stick with.I tried Aubrey's Calendula Blossom Natural deodorant spray, which is a woman's deodorant, I think, judging by the strong -- and I mean strong - scent of the calendula oil in the plastic spray bottle.  Strong though the scent may be, it was not strong enough to last 24-hours on me even though it was all natural.This Tom's of Maine natural deodorant does indeed say \"soothing calendula\" on the front of the container but, like another reviewer astutely mentioned, calendula is not listed on the list of ingredients on the back.  The stick, however, does smell exactly like calendula, although not as nostril-curdling as Aubrey's feminine calendula blossom oil, so I don't know how Tom's of Maine pulled this scent off exactly.  Maybe it was a simple oversight, a typo, on the label and it's made of calendula after all.  Maybe it's just really the case that somebody just forgot to mention it on the back.This deodorant is not a scam.  It is worth every penny for the purchase price.  It is long-lasting, up to 36 hours so far. . . .  And it's consistent, whether you're sweating or not.  What these negative reviews by women is all about I don't know.

Water-based lubes are easy to cleanup and are unlikely to cause yeast infections, but on the down side they do need to be renewed every half hour or less due to drying. Oil-based lubes tend to have maximum slipperiness and last longest, but can lead to yeast infections and tend to break down latex condoms and toys quite quickly.

I could notice body odor on myself, and my significant other even mentioned to me that I smelled--and not in a good way. (I hope my coworkers didn't notice, but I suspect they did, too.) I've been using it for about a month, and I believe some days are better than others, but I still feel worried when I wear this, especially if I'm doing any activity where I'll sweat a lot.When this product was nearly depleted, I boughtKiss My Face Scented Active Enzyme Stick Deodorant, 2.48-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6), which is ostensibly a stick version of this deodorant (although scented--I figured that could at least be a backup if the deodorant fails again). However, the ingredients and mechanism are actually quite different: the main ingredient in the stick is some sort of \"natural vegetable enzyme,\" although it contains corn starch and \"clay\" (presumably the ingredient listed as kaolin); the liquid version here is primarily potassium alum (an antiseptic, which should really work but just doesn't seem to for me), although there are other ingredients. In any case, the two are quite different products, and I find that the stick works better. (For the record, I also like the stick by Tom's, which is the only other natural deodorant I've tried so far.)There are other disadvantages to this liquid, as well: the solvent is water, which can take a long time to dry. (I know alcohol dries out some people's skin, but that's not a problem for me.) I practically have to walk around for a couple minutes with my arms in the air or blow into my underarms to speed evaporation, either of which is potentially embarrassing in a locker room.However, I appreciate the intent behind this product: a more \"natural\" deodorant, no added scents (although I wonder if the scented version might seem to work better), and a recyclable bottle. Unfortunately, three stars is the best I can give this due to its lack of consistent effectiveness. In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good idea, but not effective for me", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2011"}

They block out a lot of noise, but they are more effective at blocking higher frequency sound than low-frequency. This means that you won't be able to hear the telephone if you sleep with ear plugs in, but you might hear the neighbor's lawn mower. Their effectiveness at blocking out noise from machinery really depends upon the pitch, but foam ear plugs will always lower the volume somewhat. They're pretty good at blocking background chatter, television, or music.I've used both Flents \"Quiet! Please\" and E*A*R brands, which are identical apart from color. Flents are off-white. E*A*R plugs are yellow. They are easy to use. You simply roll the ear plug between your fingers to squish it, then insert it in your ear canal. It expands to fit your ear snugly.

My pre-ovulation temp was usually lower than that (96.2 - 96.6).  The instructions state that you should have three consecutive hours of sleep before taking your waking temperature and I rarely sleep that well.  Perhaps this is the cause of my low temperatures.  I've also read that basal thermometers should measure hundredths and this one only measures tenths.  At any rate, my cycle has a clear trend so the themometer does its job.When you turn on the thermometer, a light comes on and the previous temperature that was taken and stored in memory is displayed.  The light then goes off and you can take your temperature.  The thermometer beeps while measuring your temp.  It usually beeps about ten to fifteen times for me and then a long beeping sound lets me know it is done.  At this point, you can press the button, the light comes on and your temperature is displayed.  The thermometer then turns off.  It will automatically turn off later if you forget.

There's nothing quite like a little \"sitzen\" on this standard toilet bowl insert when it contains nice warm, soothing water perhaps with just a bit of Epsom salt or medicinal oatmeal powder to take edge off of what ails you in this regard.If you are elderly (70s +), then this also can prove to be a very useful item for essential daily hygiene without the need to take  a shower or bath every day, something that is difficult to do when those joints - especially the knees - start giving out from natural deterioration due to a life fully lived over the years.The person in my family who still regularly uses this item falls into this latter category of strictly hygienic and non-medicinal use and has always only used the plastic insert itself. There has never been a need to use the 2-quart solution bag that is included.If when you get on in years the height of the standard bathroom toilet proves to be too low for you to comfortably sit down and then get back up again with this Carex Sitz Bath insert in place, then you might want to consider combining this item with a height-adjustable \"Bedside Commode/Toilet Seat/Safety Rails - All in One\" (see my review).You can essentially substitute this Carex Sitz Bath for the gray bucket that comes with this commode and turn it into a portable bidet whenever the need arises with the added convenience of being able to adjust the height for the easy sitting down and arising of an elderly person or anyone - irrespective of age - with hip/knee problems.For the modest price of less than $15.00 being asked (I paid about $10.00 in 2009), this is a must-have item for overall health and general well-being.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just the thing for that needed hygienic pick-me-up", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}

The inhaler itself is made of sturdy plastic and feels well made.SCENT/AROMAIf you are accustomed to Vicks Inhalers, with their distinctive camphorous menthol and eucalyptus aroma, the Benzedrex inhaler will be a bit change for you. Lavender plays a starring role in this aromatic blend, backed with an ample dose of menthol, the overall effect is much more \"aromatherapy\" like, as opposed to Vicks' cool, purely medicinal notes.INGREDIENTS & EFFICACYThe active ingredient in Benzedrex is propylhexidrine, a drug related structurally to methamphetamine (related does not mean 'same as'). When inhaled, it opens up the nasal passages and sinuses, relieving pressure and congestion. Vicks inhalers active ingredient is levmetamfetamine, also an amphetamine derivative that works in much the same way.In my experience Vicks and Benzedrex are about equally effective immediately after use, but Benzedrex works much much longer -- in the hours range versus minutes with Vicks, which also makes it a better value in my opinion.IT'S FOR YOU IF...- You want decongestant relief, but don't want to take anything in pill form, or want to give your oral decongestant an added boost- You like lavender, or can at least tolerate the scent- You are a Vicks inhaler user looking for a longer-lasting upgradeTHINK TWICE IF...- You are opposed to buying online -- I live in a major metro area and have never seen Benzedrex carried at a pharmacy, though this may be a 'regional thing'.RECOMMENDED: Yes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you are a fan of the Vicks inhaler, this is an excellent upgrade...", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600, "reviewTime": "02 29, 2012"}

It doesn't chafe, either, despite the 12 hours a day he spent at the keyboard.

At this dose I can wear the patch for 24 hours a day with only mildly vivid dreams (I have those anyway so it's not a big deal).  The constant dose works for me, plus I chew 2 pieces of 2mg Nicorette gum 12 and 16 hours after applying the new patch.  NicoDerm works better than other patches I've used.  They stay on better and the dose is steadier.  Any patch will wane over time but these are as constant as you can get.I chew the gum in addition because I need slightly more than the 7mg but not as much as the 14mg patch.  I smoked a low-nicotine brand so the 14mg was too much, let alone the 21mg.  I had some withdrawal by starting with the 7mg but that subsided after 3 days and I've done fine ever since.  You can gauge which works best for you but too much nicotine is as bad as too little so I recommend a conservative approach (i.e. start with the 21mg only if you were a heavy smoker).  It's been six weeks for me and I don't even think about cigarettes anymore.  No more cough, no more sinus problems, no more smell, and I'm very happy.I have purchased these patches on sale plus a $15 off coupon at the pharmacy.

I'm not a snob, but I've come to detest even the smell of cigarette smoke. I see people smoking in their cars and I think to myself, why in the hell did I do that?

Ives Apricot Scrub is a great face wash for removing makeup, and for exfoliating old skin from your face. This consistency of this formula is thicker than most face washes, and the particles in it that make up the abrasive scrub are densely packed, so you get a ton of scrubbing cream in just a small amount of product. Much more exfoliation power than in the original Apricot Scrub version. It's great for removing long wearing, color-stay foundation, which tends to need something with a little extra scrubbing power in it to get all of it off of your skin. It cleans out pours and leaves skin super smooth, without drying it out.

I have never struggled with serious acne until about 8 months ago. I don't know what happened, but one day I started getting a few pimples and then within a month I was breaking out all over my cheeks, forehead, and chin. It was really distressing because I had NEVER had this kind of painful acne before in my life. Before and during this time I didn't change anything in my diet, skincare routine, or environment so the only thing I could think of that caused the severe acne was maybe stress from school (other than that, I have no idea)?I tried many different products to get rid of the acne, expensive ones and cheap ones...... none of them worked. I tried using them for a good period of time to make sure I let it take effect too (like, a month). I was really subconscious of my face b/c of the scars that were left behind and the extremely noticeable acne. Well, I went to visit my sister last x-mas and she had this scrub. I used it while at her place and my skin felt really good after that week, so I bought a bottle when I got home. I have been using it every time I'm in the shower and within a few weeks my acne was reduced and within a month about 90% of it was gone. It's been almost 3 months now and my acne is GONE, minus the occasional pimples again. I am sooooooooooo thankful for this product for saving my skin!!!! I'm still sad that I have all these scars left, but I'm hoping that they'll fade over time as I continue to use this exfoliator.So, it has helped dramatically with my sudden acne onset, but I don't think it has done anything w/ my blackheads (as many people have stated). Also, after using this product you should MOISTURIZE your skin!! The beads are taking off dead skin cells, so the freshly exposed skin may be more prone to some moisture loss if just left there. MOISTURIZE it!!! Plus, it should more readily absorb whatever you're putting on it and be super soft afterwards.

The flaps open easily and stay in an 'opened' position until closed again. This makes it easy to open all of the compartments at once and leave them open while filling. The compartments close with a reassuring tactile 'snap' and seem secure enough to travel in a handbag or briefcase. By virtue of the extraordinary size of the pill case, the labels featuring days of the week are commensurately large, and should be quite legible even for those with significant vision impairment.CAPACITYHands down the standout feature of this pill box is its capacity. If you regularly take a large number of medications (especially bulky tablets and capsules), or take a large number of dietary supplements, then this is the pill box for you. It so happens that I fall into both categories, so finding something capacious enough to handle my daily Rx and OTC meds, plus all of my dietary supplements was quite a challenge.I'm both a lazy and busy person, so I bought four of these so I'd only have to load them up once a month.

{"reviewerID": "A22BGI38W7Q9X9", "asin": "B0000537JQ", "reviewerName": "PWTSM", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "First I'd like to acknowledge that I realize, or I discovered from trial and error, that pill cases are something that should be chosen by the person who will be filling them and administering the medicine/pills, because there are numerous different kinds, sizes, and styles and each one is good for different reasons. It's a very personal item, and everyone will like or hate certain types for their own, very good reasons.This review is for the 3XL but the general features and quality of the product should hold true to any size of this exact design (EZY Dose brand XL, 2XL, 3XL).SHORT & SWEET REVIEW - If you want the short & sweet version of my review, know that I chose this one because it was easy to fill, easy to handle, easy to dispense, had the number of days I wanted, was the size I needed in overall dimensions as well as the size of each compartment, is stackable, and it did not pop open when it should not. If you want a more in depth review, see below.FULL REVIEWI purchased the EZY Dose 3XL for $4.29 in 2011 and I'm very happy I did. I rarely recommend something that's a bit more expensive. I only do if the item is much better in quality than cheaper ones and therefore worth the extra money. I purchased others that were cheaper, and had to return them. The biggest problems I had with other designs were the compartments popping open when moved or if something accidently touched it, ease of opening and closing compartments, ease of dispensing (pouring out the contents), and size (holding enough pills).> DIMENSIONS OF THE 3XL SIZE:To give you an idea of how many pills the EZY Dose 3XL will hold - I measured it by filling one compartment with water and found it holds 2 fluid ounces (2/3 of a 3 oz bathroom Dixie cup). So, to know if your pills will all fit, put your pills in a 3 oz Dixie cup and if your pills don't fill up the cup more than 2/3, you should have no problem. That's the easiest way to know, if you can't test it first (when you buy online). See below for exact dimensions of the 3XL. See our photo above for a comparison with two other pill organizers.The total outer dimensions are 11\" long, 2 5/16\" deep (including levers and hinges), 1 5/16\" tall (including the little brail nodes).The inner dimensions of each compartment are 1.5\" wide, 2 1/16\" deep (front to back), and just under 1 /18\" tall (bottom to top). And again, as I mentioned above, the volume is 2 oz liquid measure. But of course you do not want to put liquids in it, that's just to give you an idea of the size of the compartment. I put 22 pills of various sizes in one compartment and it's only 3/4 full. I wanted it to be this large because I might have more pills to take in the future and wanted the \"room to grow\", plus if you try to stuff too many into any case you can make it pop open just by over loading it, stuffing it too full. I can easily put another 10 to 15 pills in the EZY Dose 3XL (for a total of nearly 40 pills) without any problem.POST NOTE 4-8-13, REGARDING SIZE: Today I noticed this ad no longer gives the choice of the 3XL size but only offers the \"Jumbo\" and \"2XL\" sizes. However, the 2XL is currently described in this ad as approximately 9\"L x 2\"W x 1\"D in size and the \"Jumbo\" is currently described as being approximately 11\"L x 2.4\"Wx 1\"D. If this is true it would mean the \"Jumbo\" is larger than the \"2XL\" and nearly the same size as the 3XL I have. So that means either the \"Jumbo\" described here is in fact the 3XL size or the description of the \"Jumbo\" here is incorrect. Either way, for this ad, I highly recommend you contact the seller first to confirm the outer dimensions of the product you order.> SECURE, STAYS CLOSED, EASY OPEN:I had purchased other pill organizers but they were smaller and none of the other simple basic holders I tested held the pills securely and simply, without popping open, without having to fumble with special levers (I'm referring to the plain style, not the lockable, which can be confusing on Amazon since some photos are incorrect), without the extra space special levers and markers took up. I wanted simple, compact but large (but only 7 days), and secure, and that's what I got with this EZ Dose 3XL design.I placed this in my larger bag (purse) in a realistic walk from my home to my car and shopping all day and had no problem with it popping open. I also tossed it and dropped it onto my counter several times (with and without pills in it) and it never popped open like others did. But I do not recommend tossing this (or any product like it) loosely, without care, into any bag. It's not made for that. It's made for sitting on a counter, a table, or in a drawer. Personally, if I knew I was going to bring it with me in a bag (purse) every day I'd slide it into an umbrella cover, just to be sure. I have several umbrella covers with no use, since I never put them back on my umbrellas once I take it off the first time so I'm happy to find a great use for them anyway.> STACKABLE:Another great feature that I noticed only after I bought it is the tiny nodes on the bottom (at the corners) which fit into tiny holes in the top of another, making more than one securely stackable on top of each other. I was surprised to find this feature since the nodes and matching holes that allow secure stacking are barely noticeable. I found them by accident. But when I realized I could securely stack these I loved them even more.> HAS BRAILLE MARKINGS which are easy to read (feel).> THIS DESIGN IS RECOMMENDED, EVEN IF MONTHLY PILL ORGANIZING IS NEEDED:Lastly, for those of you who hate the boring and tedious chore of preparing pills every day like I do, and want to use a pill organizer that has many more compartments, I do NOT recommend the kind with a sliding plastic lid like thisEzy Dose Four-a-day Weekly Maxi-pharmadose Medication Organizeror thisEZY Dose Four-A-Day Weekly Practidose Medication Organizer. I have one like this, and it's very difficult (especially if you have dexterity problems) to pour the pills out and not have them end up all over the counter or floor. It's just very awkward to pour them out. If you insist on using a larger pill organizer that holds more than 7 days or has more than 7 compartments, make sure the organizer allows you to remove one row or one compartment at a time from the entire case. It should lift out, so you can easily open the compartment and pour the pills out into your hand (or a cup for a patient), similar to this one:Ezy Dose Large Four a Day Weekly, One Day At a Time Medication Organizer. But after using this 3XL EZY Dose dispenser every day for over a year, as well as smaller ones for other purposes, I can say I still love the 3XL EZY Dose dispenser and recommend it even for those who want to prepare a month or more of pills in advance. Since they are securely stackable (and don't pop open if it does topple over) I recommend buying as many as you need and stacking up to 3 or 4 high - much better than any other monthly system I've found. Unfortunately as of today's date the 3XL is no longer available through this exact listing but I'm hoping to find it elsewhere on Amazon since this design and the 3XL size is so hard to find in any local store (and I looked in several states during trips)..... Just found this, it appears to be what I bought at about the same price:JUMBO 7 Day Pill Box- 2 pack~As I mentioned above, I was looking for a very simple, easy to read, easy to open, easy to handle, clear, 7 day pill case that would hold a large amount of pills and hold them securely, without popping open. This was the largest and best I found that held 7 days. I looked online and in stores in my area. I did not buy my first 2 from Amazon, but now that I know they have them at a reasonable price that I can afford, I'll be buying more because I find preparing my daily pills to be boring, annoying, and monotonous and I want to be able to prepare 4 to 8 weeks of pills at one time, so I'll be buying at least 4 to 6 more through Amazon this time (so I don't have to drive to the one store I finally found that carries this). I have Amazon Prime free shipping privileges, so that's a plus too. If you want to know how to get Amazon Prime free shipping, just ask me.Highly recommended if you want secure function along with a simple, clear, easy open, large, nothing busy looking, fancy or complicated design. But as I mentioned above, I highly recommend, before making your purchase, that you look closely at the many different kinds of pill organizers there are available to you here at Amazon and in your local stores, and make sure you get the one that's best for you. You have many choices, which is rare these days.Wishing you all Good Health, Happiness, and Prosperity", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Made, Secure Close, Easy Open, Stackable, Braille Markings", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2012"}

The \"max\" has to be different in some ingredient or quality from the \"Original Strength\":a). original strength is 10mg and always works great... I normally take 2 (20mg) up to 3x a day. Been taking it for a few years due to medical condition requiring certain medication that can upset stomach to overacidity. Pepcid AC is not known to interact with my medication, per my doctor and the literature.b). \"maximum strength\" is 20 mg and label reads the same as original strength, BUT DOESN'T WORK.c). Last year and again this year, cvs ran out of the original strength which is reliable. I tried maximum strength (1 pill only, because it's supposed to be equivalent to 2 original/10mg pills).d). Both times \"max strength\" didn't control my stomach, and after 2 or so days, I got overactive gas bloating gurgling etc and painful acidity. Both times I returned to original strength pepcid AC and got relief almost immediately. THIS time from the \"max strength\" version not working effectively, I also got some ulcerated sore spots in my stomach (endoscopy confirmed). Also the first night I was not only in pain but also very nauseated and threw up a few times (no blood), after which the nausea went away, though the extreme stomach acidic and gut upset remained. Once I obtained and returned to original strength version of pepcid ac, the acidic stomach problem became again controllable, so that my stomach could heal after the ulcers caused by the \"max strength\" not working. Both times, this year and last year, my diet, medication, stressors, and other conditions or variables were and have been the SAME before and after... only difference was version of pepcid used.e). I conclude that \"maximum strength\" is NOT the same strength, though label statement of ingredients look the same and 1 pill is supposed to be same dosage as 2 original pills. The active ingredient must not be the same strength in actuality, and/or there must be some different other \"inactive\" ingredient, filler or synthesis or manufacturing trace byproduct.f). I will avoid \"maximum strength\" pepcid ac from now on like the plague, and stock up on \"original strength\" pepcid ac several at a time and then reorder.PS: I found that amazon offers the best price on pepcid ac original strength 10mg, so thank the Lord so my stomach doesn't become porous, I can not be up all night, and other dangerous nasty situations.

Many companies produce so-called generic drugs by simply taking the standard recipe and reducing the amount of medication by as much as 20%.

I try to find something wrong with it and can not. It just won't cut/nick or cause razor burn. It really is the most perfect razor I've ever shaved with; better than it's brothers the Hydro's, the Quattro and the Schick ST2 (which I'm passionate about my ST2's) and the Quattro is darned hard to beat...but the Extreme3 is as close to a perfect razor I've ever had.  Give it a try!  Also: You won't find a better price anywhere online than Amazon.com for this (and many) product! It pays to go Prime too:)I've been on a year long search for the \"Perfect Razor\" to shave with and I've finally found it in the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade Sensitive.  With a medium/coarse beard and sensitive skin (that's gotten worse as I get older) I just got sick of the constant compromise between a smooth close shave with raw throbbing face for 2 - 3 days or a comfortable shave and a face with patches of stubble.  The Schick Xtreme 3 gives me a smooth, close shave with no stubble but also with no razor burn and no nicks or cuts as long as I practice the shaving technique recommended by Edge Shave Gel; which I also have purchased from Amazon.com.  For others like me that also use a shaving brush and shaving soap; this razor works great with my Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin and my tweezerman's shaving brush; both of which I bought at Amazon for a better price than I found elsewhere.Unlike the D/E razors and twin blade cartridges, you don't have to do a 3 - or - 4 way shave with a triple blade razor.  Edge suggests you wash your face first, apply their shaving gel (which is the best I've ever used), let the lather sit on your beard for three minutes to soften the beard and then shave...Against The Grain!  That's almost heresy to me:)  After 44 years of shaving the idea of not taking the beard down in stages and starting against the grain...makes me wince in pain at the thought of it. But it works!  The only thing I do different is I also use the Proraso Pre-Shave cream I purchased here at Amazon.com to provide myself with a slicker shaving surface before I apply the shave gel and I shave against the grain for my entire face with no problem at all.  The Schick Xtreme 3 glides smoothly across my face against the grain, weather it's a next day shave or after three days of not shaving.  I get about 7 - 8 shaves per razor which costs me about 0.17 cents a shave at Amazon's great price and that's good enough for me.  Price is very important to me but watching the shaving cream turn pink with blood oozing through my pores with the D/E blades and the pain afterward...0.17 cents is cheap enough.  It's an excellent razor for sensitive skin and the Edge Shave Gel 'against the grain' instructions gives me a perfect pain free shave with a once over instead of going over my face several times or doing multiple touch ups.

Ha, ha, ha, I'm kidding, of course. The box wasn't THAT big, just much bigger than necessary for the contents: one solitary Power Bar of the fruit smoothie variety.I tore open the wrapping, took a bite, and said, \"Hmm, this isn't bad.\" It had a kind of strawberry flavor. On the other hand, it had a texture similar to a Tootsie Roll which once laid claim to one of my teeth. To avoid an expensive dental accident, I chewed softly and slowly until an aftertaste began to emerge. Hmm. Not sure about that aftertaste.I carried on, biting off another piece, chewing, swallowing, etc, until I reached the final bite. It was then that I'd had enough and tossed the remainder in the trash.Final verdict: I didn't like it. Something about that aftertaste. It wasn't horrible, just a little unpleasant, and the original flavor couldn't compensate. So sorry.  Oh, I almost forgot. This is a \"power\" bar which means it's supposed to give you a burst of energy (or something) after you eat it.  Did it have the intended effect? I really don't know. I drink so much coffee that the caffeine almost certainly overwhelmed the ingredients in the power bar.Brian W.

This is the most foul tasting power bar I have ever had the misfortune to consume.  It's rather gooey in texture and bitterly sweet with an overpowering, intense, awful fruit flavoring.  It's loaded with sugar and calories, which is what a power bar typically consists of, but I've had others that at least didn't leave your taste buds damaged for the rest of the day.

This was a recommended product for me I'm assuming because I've ordered various protein products from Amazon in the past. I take protein supplements daily as I've had an RNY gastric bypass and don't absorb protein as well as non-surgically-altered folks. When this product came up as a recommendation, I assumed (silly me!) that it was a protein bar. It sounded good so I agreed to try it.Now, it IS very tasty! I tried the strawberry 'fruit smoothie' flavor and it was a nice gooey, chewy sweet bar. However, it is NOT a protein bar, but an \"energy bar.\" For me, it has far too little protein (6 grams) and far too many carbs (42 grams, with 24 grams of those being sugar carbs) to be something I would actually order again and consume regularly. (If those stats were reversed, I'd be ecstatic!) In addition, I'd like to see more fiber in something like this--less than 1 gram in this bar.Going strictly on taste--it's great! If carbs don't bother you and you are looking for a quick energy boost with some vitamin and mineral supplementation in a sweet, fruity, chewy bar and are willing to spend 210 calories to get it, this is probably something you'd enjoy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great tasting bar....", "unixReviewTime": 1214265600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2008"}

Some slight differences but still that aftertaste.I am happy to report that the PowerBar Energize Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie bar has no aftertaste. It isn't too sweet. It isn't gritty.

I wasn't expecting much in the \"taste\" department, so that was a pleasant surprise. So what does it taste like?  Well, as far as texture... it's very chewy like Starburst candy or Airheads but also has some crunchiness to it like in a chewy Granola bar. It's sort of a cross between those two things. And it tastes kind of like \"fruit loops\" cereal :)So because it's packed with vitamins, protein, yada yada yada, and actually tastes good...  I can't complain.
